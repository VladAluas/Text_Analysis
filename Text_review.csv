OnePlus 1,Introduction,"The days of the $600 smartphone aren't over quite yet, but if the OnePlus One is any indication of things to come, the end is nigh. For $299 (16GB) or $349 (64GB), OnePlus delivers a remarkably high-end phablet that in many ways eclipses the quality on offer from big names like Samsung and LG. There are still a handful of bugs here, but none too egregious, and I'm optimistic that OnePlus can issue fixes in short order. From its name-brand processor to its impeccable display, the OnePlus One is every bit the hero device fans have anticipated. Dollar-for-dollar, it's the best unlocked smartphone value around. Our Editors' Choice, however, remains the Google Nexus 6, which redefines the mobile computing experience with a massive display, powerful performance, and stock Android software."
OnePlus 1,"Design, Features, and Call Quality","The OnePlus One doesn't feel like a sub-$400 phone, unless your expectations are informed solely by Nexus 5( at Amazon) experience. Its clean lines and tight build quality evoke a sense of desirability that's sorely lacking in the budget-friendly realm. Yes it's big (6.02 by 2.99 by 0.35 inches) and yes it's all plastic, but size is a given with phablets, and think solid Nokia polycarbonate—not glossy and flexible Samsung plastic."
OnePlus 1,"Design, Features, and Call Quality","Our white test unit features a so-called silk finish, which is just a fancy way to say matte, while the black model has a textured sandstone finish. The back cover is actually removable too, and OnePlus promises swappable options in finishes like real wood and carbon fiber. OnePlus's philosophy might be ""never settle,"" but fans of removable batteries and expandable storage will have to settle for the non-removable 3,100mAh battery and built-in storage. In our initial tests, the OnePlus One lasted for 17 hours of continuous talk time, but dropped the call with about 10% battery life remaining. That should be more than enough battery life for a day's worth of moderate use, and anecdotally, I never felt strapped for battery life while testing."
OnePlus 1,"Design, Features, and Call Quality","The 5.5-inch, 1080p IPS display is on par with the best I've seen, including the HTC One (M8) and Samsung Galaxy S5. You won't be able to discern any real difference in sharpness at this level (401 ppi), while the viewing angle is nearly 180 degrees and color reproduction is neutral without looking muted. Below the display are capacitive Menu, Home, and Back buttons, but you can disable them in favor of standard software navigation buttons."
OnePlus 1,"Design, Features, and Call Quality","There are two speaker grilles flanking the micro USB port on the bottom edge, which get surprisingly loud, but still sound pretty thin. Above the display is a multi-colored notification LED that is far too bright on its default configuration, but can be toned down in the settings menu."
OnePlus 1,"Design, Features, and Call Quality","With GSM (850/900/1800/1900MHz), UMTS (Bands 1/2/4/5/8), and LTE (Bands 1/3/4/7/17/38/40), the OnePlus One is well equipped to handle a variety of networks, including AT&T and T-Mobile here in the U.S. I tested the phone with an AT&T SIM, which worked perfectly in New York City."
OnePlus 1,"Design, Features, and Call Quality","Call quality, unfortunately, was one of the biggest sore spots for the OnePlus One. Volume in the earpiece is frustratingly weak and made callers on the other end sound muted, distant, and difficult to hear over even the most innocuous of ambient noise. Transmissions through the mic fared better, coming through more clearly, but still on the low side for volume. The headphone jack works fine for music, unlike in our initial hands on, but the OnePlus One couldn't route calls through a wired headset."
OnePlus 1,"Design, Features, and Call Quality","I also noticed a bug when it came to the phone's proximity sensor on calls. In most phones, taking the phone away from your face during or after a call will wake the screen from sleep. This almost never worked correctly in my tests, making it near impossible for me to end a call without fiddling with the Power button. Group texting worked fine with a number of iPhone and Android users, but the OnePlus one had some issues downloading pictures sent as MMS."
OnePlus 1,"Design, Features, and Call Quality","Also onboard are dual-band 802.11b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi, NFC, and Bluetooth 4.0. The OnePlus One had no problem connecting to a multitude of Wi-Fi networks and easily paired with an Era by Jawbone Bluetooth headset."
OnePlus 1,Performance and CyanogenMod,"The OnePlus One is powered by a quad-core 2.5GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 SoC and 3GB RAM. It's the fastest silicon around at the moment and the same foundation found in flagship phones like the GS5 and M8. This alone is a triumph for a budget-friendly, unlocked phone, many of which opt for off-the-shelf parts from companies like MediaTek. Performance is everything you'd expect given the specs—there's immediacy to every input and I couldn't find any tasks that taxed the One too heavily."
OnePlus 1,Performance and CyanogenMod,"Part of that speed is thanks to the clean and lite CyanogenMod 11S software, based on Android 4.4.2. For the uninitiated, CyanogenMod is one of the most prominent names in the Android development world. CyanogenMod's vision combines stock Android sensibilities with the utility of aftermarket features that you won't find in skins like TouchWiz or Sense. And unlike those two, CyanogenMod is completely customizable, meaning if you don't like something, you don't ever have to deal with it. Though better suited for tinkerers, it's also easy enough to use for mainstream audiences. There's a laundry list of tweaks and features available, but I'll focus on some of the more important ones here."
OnePlus 1,Performance and CyanogenMod,"Gesture and voice commands are available out of the box, allowing for double-tap to wake and touchless controls a la Moto X($179.99 at Amazon). CM takes things a step further, letting you draw a V when the screen is off to launch straight into the flashlight, or draw a circle to launch straight into the camera, both of which worked reliably in my tests. The same cannot be said for voice commands, though, especially with the screen off. Instead of ""OK Google Now,"" the OnePlus One trains itself to recognize ""Hey Snapdragon"" to launch Google Now's voice recognition. This worked for me about 30 percent of the time, and I'd typically have to yell it or enunciate unnaturally to get it to work. When it does work, it functions more or less on the same level as the Moto X. You can ask for weather forecasts, send texts, set reminders, or any other function available via Google Now."
OnePlus 1,Performance and CyanogenMod,"Easily swappable UI elements and themes are a trademark of CyanogenMod, allowing users to change icons, fonts, wallpapers, and lock screens. There's a built-in theme store, but a quick search in Google Play will turn up hundreds of compatible themes to choose from. Themed or stock, the OnePlus One never showed signs of slowing down. You can toggle whether you use the on-screen or capacitive navigation buttons, but I noticed a small bug using the on-screen option. Launching straight into Google Now caused the navigation bar to lose its transparency effect and show up as a thick black bar along the bottom. Locking and unlocking the phone returned the bar to its transparent state, so it's only a minor quibble."
OnePlus 1,Performance and CyanogenMod,"OnePlus puts an emphasis on security, offering encrypted text messaging between devices running CyanogenMod and granular control over individual app permissions with Privacy Guard. Instead of being locked into the all-or-nothing permissions model of standard Android builds, OnePlus One users can control exactly what your app has access to, blocking some permissions while keeping others. Digging into Privacy Guard also lets you see when each app made use of individual permissions, which can be helpful in determining which permissions it really needs to function. Keep in mind that disabling some permissions can cause apps to work erratically or break all together."
OnePlus 1,Cameras and Conclusions,"The OnePlus One comes equipped with a 13-megapixel, rear-facing camera with dual-LED flash and a 5-megapixel front-facing camera. OnePlus says it uses a Sony Exmor IMX 214 sensor with an f/2.0 aperture for gathering more light and a six-element lens to cut down on distortion. CEO Peter Lau claims that the camera was optimized for ""real-life conditions,"" and in my tests I found that to be mostly true. In good lighting, images look alive with detail and true-to-life colors. Autofocus was nearly instantaneous, but exposure was hit or miss and dynamic range was only average. Unfortunately, that low-distortion claim doesn't hold up—towards the edges of the frame you can see straight lines becoming awkwardly warped and unnatural. In low light and indoors, the camera did an admirable job balancing grain with detail, but images still ended up looking soft, especially if subjects weren't completely still. I prefer them to the results I saw with the GS5 in low-light, but the HTC One (M8) still takes better low-light images."
OnePlus 1,Cameras and Conclusions,"The OnePlus One is capable of 4K video recording, but it's not very practical—video quality takes a big hit compared with its 1080p footage, especially indoors, while frame rates can dip below 15 frames per second and autofocus becomes painfully slow. Standard 1080p footage looks vivid and lifelike in good lighting, but graininess creeps in even under modestly lit scenarios."
OnePlus 1,Cameras and Conclusions,"There's a sea change underway in the mobile world, and consumers are going to be the big winners here. Carriers like T-Mobile are moving towards unsubsidized and contract-free models, while companies like Google, Motorola, and now OnePlus are redefining expectations for affordable smartphones. The OnePlus One is hopefully a harbinger of things to come; a no-compromise device that challenges the current hegemony of subsidized smartphones and contract-bound service plans. If the untested company can maintain quality control and meet demand, the One will be the smartphone to beat. Though it's not as great of a value as the One, Google's Nexus 6 continues to impress with its beautiful display and stock Android software. Otherwise, the OnePlus One is the most phone for the least money. "
OnePlus 2,Introduction,"The OnePlus 2 is every bit the ""flagship killer"" the rogue smartphone manufacturer promises, packed with the latest in mobile tech at an unbelievably low price of $389 for the 64GB model. And that's unlocked. The company's much-maligned invite-only retail model remains, but that unconventional approach helps profit margins, so few competitors can deliver a higher price-to-performance ratio than OnePlus. The OnePlus 2 is a better value than high-end unlocked phones like the ZTE Axon Pro ($238.00 at Amazon)  and easily outclasses budget-friendly options like the Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 ($139.00 at Amazon) . It's our new Editors' Choice for unlocked smartphones, offering unparalleled value and performance in a spectacular complete package. You just have to be lucky enough to get an invitation to buy one. "
OnePlus 2,"Design, Features, and Network Performance","OnePlus doesn't stray too far from its inaugural effort, the OnePlus One, focusing instead on subtle refinements and tight execution. The wonderfully textured sandstone finish helps assuage any plastic prejudices, while the new rigid metal frame exudes quality.  At 5.98 by 2.95 by 0.39 inches and 6.17 ounces, the OnePlus 2 ($299.00 at Plusnet Mobile)  is on the large side by conventional standards—much bigger than the Samsung Galaxy S6 ( at Amazon)  (5.65 by 2.78 by 0.27 inches, 4.87 ounces) and only a hair smaller than the ZTE Axon Pro (6.06 by 2.9 by 0.37 inches, 6.3 ounces). Pleasantly stiff Power and Volume buttons line the right edge, while a dedicated alert slider on the left edge mutes notifications. Along the bottom edge is a new USB Type-C port, which offers a number of advantages to micro USB like faster speeds and reversible design. The back plate peels off to reveal the dual SIM card slot and sealed battery, and OnePlus sells swappable backs in exotic materials like rosewood and Kevlar."
OnePlus 2,"Design, Features, and Network Performance","The 5.5-inch, full HD LCD might not wow the spec obsessed, but the display nearly matches the S6's blinding maximum brightness, while colors and whites look cleaner and true to life. Contrast is excellent, as are viewing angles. Below the display is a combination Home button and fingerprint reader flanked by programmable capacitive navigation buttons. The Home button is also capacitive, rather than physical, and OnePlus also lets you opt for on-screen software navigation buttons instead, if you'd prefer."
OnePlus 2,"Design, Features, and Network Performance","Sold completely unlocked, the OnePlus supports a wide range of wireless spectrum. In the U.S., it'll work on AT&T and T-Mobile with full support for 4G LTE on both carriers. I tested with an AT&T SIM, which worked without any additional configuration. Call quality was excellent in my tests, putting the OnePlus One's struggles in the rearview mirror. The earpiece is punchy and offers solid dynamic range with no distortion at maximum volume. Callers' voices sound full and intelligible, while transmissions through the mic were equally clean with natural tone. Noise cancellation works well for moderate indoor distractions, but the OnePlus 2 still let through a good amount of noise from a busy city street in testing. The speakerphone pumps out loud volume, but it sounds very harsh at top levels."
OnePlus 2,"Design, Features, and Network Performance","The handset supports 802.11b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi on the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, as well as Bluetooth 4.1 and GPS. In side-by-side tests, the OnePlus 2 was able to keep pace with the Galaxy S6 in Wi-Fi speed, notching an impressive 115Mbps peak download rate to the S6's 118Mbps. Upload speeds lagged behind the S6, hovering around 6Mbps to the S6's 10Mbps average."
OnePlus 2,Performance and Android,"The original OnePlus One was notable for being among the first affordable unlocked phones to use a high-end Qualcomm chip. That tradition continues in the OnePlus 2 and its Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 SoC, which is clocked at a slightly lower 1.8GHz to the ZTE Axon's 2GHz Snapdragon 810. The phone gets noticeably warm at times, but not uncomfortably so. Benchmarks were right in line with phones like the Axon or the LG G4, and numbers didn't dip after running intensive games like GTA: San Andreas for an hour. If you opt for the 64GB model, you also get 4GB RAM, versus 3GB for the 16GB model ($329). That means strong multitasking chops, which allowed me to jump between resource-heavy games or apps without losing my place or reloading during testing. I noticed a few bugs during my testing period, including intermittent lag between app launches and some random, but infrequent, Home button unresponsiveness."
OnePlus 2,Performance and Android,"OnePlus parted ways with the CyanogenMod team that handled the software for OnePlus One. The OnePlus 2 runs Android 5.1 with OnePlus' OxygenOS tweaks on top. Thankfully, OxygenOS is very close to stock Android with only a handful of thoughtful, unobtrusive additions. Gestures like double-tap to wake and drawing a circle to open the camera are easily toggled on or off. You can also opt for software navigation buttons or just swap the Back and Recent Apps functions on the capacitive buttons. The most visible addition is the optional Shelf home screen feature. The Shelf is an adaptive screen that shows your frequently used apps and contacts, as well as a space for widgets. I don't find it all that useful, though, and it can easily be disabled."
OnePlus 2,Performance and Android,Our 64GB test unit came with 53.01GB available out of the box. Bloatware is essentially non-existent here: the only two preloads are an audio tuning app and SwiftKey's popular keyboard replacement.
OnePlus 2,Performance and Android,"In a battery rundown test, where we streamed a YouTube video over LTE with screen brightness set to max, the OnePlus 2 lasted 5 hours, 19 minutes. That handily beats the Alcatel One Touch Idol 3's 4 hours and 12 minutes in the same test."
OnePlus 2,Camera and Conclusions,"There's a 13-megapixel, rear-facing camera with optical image stabilization. The 1/2.6-inch OmniVision image sensor is the same physical size as the Sony IMX240 image sensor featured on the Galaxy S6. Image quality was very good in my tests, with well-balanced, detail-rich shots in bright outdoor light. Most high-end smartphones take great looking photos in good light, though, and the real test is low-light performance. Under low indoor lighting, the OnePlus 2 was still able to eke out some nice detail and good looking images, but results weren't quite up to the same level as the S6. Image noise isn't overwhelming, but the OnePlus 2's shots showed more grain and smudged details, which could be a sign of overaggressive noise reduction. For example, lettering on labels or books was more legible on the S6's shots in my test photos. Color accuracy is a strength here, though, as everything looked more true to life than Samsung's often over-saturated renditions. Focus and capture speed lag aren't nearly on the same level as the S6's camera, which can make capturing action in low light with the OnePlus 2 tough. Video quality tops out at 4K, but footage looks slightly jarring due to lower frame rates. Full HD video quality is excellent and right in line with the Galaxy S6's output."
OnePlus 2,Camera and Conclusions,"The original OnePlus One was almost too good to be true—in fact, supply shortages along the way made us wonder if the company ever intended to sell many units in the first place. Now with a year under its belt to work out the kinks, we're ready to put a little faith back into OnePlus and its ability to actually get phones into customers' hands. The OnePlus 2 retains the power, polish, and aggressive pricing of its predecessor, making it the unlocked phone to beat and our Editors' Choice. It's a more refined, less expensive alternative to the ZTE Axon Pro, and far more feature-rich than the Alcatel One Touch Idol 3, our other two top picks for unlocked smartphones."
OnePlus X,Introduction,"Unlike the OnePlus One and the OnePlus 2, the new OnePlus X ($249; 16GB) isn't being advertised as a ""flagship killer."" Instead, it is aimed at shaking up the budget market. This compact, premium Android phone doesn't make any major hardware compromises—and it's easy to use one-handed. That makes it a rare commodity these days, but thanks to a pesky invite-only purchase system and the lack of key North American bands, the OnePlus X is difficult to recommend over rival unlocked phones like the Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 4.7 and the Google Nexus 5X."
OnePlus X,"Design, Display, and Features","The OnePlus X has an attractive, premium build. It's essentially two slabs of glass held in place by a metal frame, similar in design to the classic Apple iPhone 4. It measures 5.51 by 2.72 by 0.27 inches (HWD) and weighs 4.86 ounces, making it easy to hold and use with just one hand. The Nexus 5X (5.79 by 2.86 by 0.31 inches, 4.8 ounces) is notably larger, while the Idol 3 (5.40 by 2.59 by 0.30 inches, 3.88 ounces) is slightly smaller, but not nearly as sleek. The glass back has a habit of picking up smudges, and feels a bit slippery in your hand, so you'll probably want to consider getting a case."
OnePlus X,"Design, Display, and Features","The front of the phone is home to a 5-inch AMOLED display. It packs 441 pixels per inch into its 16:9 frame, matching the native resolution of 1080p video. Everything looks crisp and bright, with rich colors and good viewing angles, even outdoors. This is an excellent screen for the price."
OnePlus X,"Design, Display, and Features","Three capacitive touch buttons sit below the display, unlit and a bit hard to see. You have the option of switching to on-screen buttons, but I found that it wasn't worth the loss of screen real estate. There's a clicky metal power button and a volume rocker on the right, and an alert slider on the left, all of which are easy to reach. The alert slider is a welcome feature introduced on the OnePlus 2; it toggles between All Notifications, Priority Interruptions, and No Interruptions without having to unlock your phone."
OnePlus X,"Design, Display, and Features","Notable features missing on the OnePlus X include a fingerprint scanner and fast charging, both of which are present on the OnePlus 2 and can be found on the Nexus 5X. Then again, you're paying a lot less for the OnePlus X, and neither of these features are indispensable."
OnePlus X,Network Performance and Sound,"The OnePlus X supports GSM (850/900/1800/1900MHz), WCDMA (1/2/4/5/8), and LTE (1/2/4/5/7/8) bands. There is no CDMA, so you can't use the phone on Sprint or Verizon. Even on AT&T and T-Mobile, however, your performance might be affected by the lack of some key bands."
OnePlus X,Network Performance and Sound,"There is no Band 12 support for T-Mobile, which will reduce connectivity outside of cities. I tested the OnePlus X on T-Mobile's network in midtown Manhattan and found it to be acceptably fast. But that's well inside city limits, and the lack of Band 12 isn't a problem in that area."
OnePlus X,Network Performance and Sound,"Testing the OnePlus X on AT&T was a different story. Here, the device is missing Band 17, which helps improve connectivity indoors. The phone remained stuck on HSPA+ most of the time I was inside, but even when I was able to connect to LTE outdoors speeds weren't particularly impressive—the highest download speed I clocked was 8.76Mbps."
OnePlus X,Network Performance and Sound,"Voice calls and noise cancellation, on the other hand, are just fine both on both AT&T and T-Mobile. The bottom-facing speakers get loud without sounding too tinny."
OnePlus X,Network Performance and Sound,"Wi-Fi is limited to 2.4GHz 802.11b/g/n. Bluetooth 4.0 is included, along with a proximity sensor, an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and an ambient light sensor. There's no NFC, but that's not a surprise considering it's also absent on the higher-end OnePlus 2."
OnePlus X,Network Performance and Sound,"Ultimately, I get the sense that the OnePlus X was never truly targeted for the U.S. market, where the phablet reigns supreme. The big sales are probably going to happen in China, India, and other emerging markets."
OnePlus X,Processor and Battery,"From a hardware perspective, the OnePlus X is essentially a repackaged version of the OnePlus One. There's a Snapdragon 801 processor, 3GB of RAM, and 16GB of internal storage. The OnePlus X can accommodate dual SIM cards, or a single SIM and a microSD card up to 128GB. It couldn't read our 200GB SanDisk ($64.00 at Amazon) card during testing, though it did recognize that a card had been inserted."
OnePlus X,Processor and Battery,"In terms of general usage and multitasking, the Snapdragon 801 continues to hold up well, despite its age. App switching and app launching were both speedy in my tests. The only time the hardware started to show its age was when playing games like Asphalt 8. I noticed the occasional frame drop, suggesting that the Adreno 330 GPU was struggling at certain points. Benchmarks also show this to be true. The OnePlus X got an AnTuTu score of 39,787, which is significantly lower than the Snapdragon 808-powered Nexus 5X (51,880)."
OnePlus X,Processor and Battery,"Battery life is good, though not great. With its 2,525mAh battery, the OnePlus X clocked 5 hours, 45 minutes in our rundown test where we set screen brightness to max and stream full-screen video over LTE. That's a little better than the OneTouch Idol 3 (5 hours, 14 minutes), but almost an hour less than the Nexus 5X (6 hours, 32 minutes)."
OnePlus X,Camera,"The OnePlus X takes crisp, clear shots with its 13-megapixel rear camera, with excellent detail. Autofocus and autoexposure are both reliable, and the device can shoot just as quickly as the Nexus 5X. The OnePlus X also has burst mode, which is something the 5X lacks."
OnePlus X,Camera,"Using both phones side by side, the only notable difference between the two is white balance. The OnePlus X captures warmer, slightly more saturated colors than necessarily accurate when compared with the Nexus 5X. Low-light performance isn't as strong here, with more grain and noise."
OnePlus X,Camera,"The OnePlus X is capable of 1080p video capture at 30 frames per second (fps) and 720p slow-mo video at 120fps. Despite the lack of optical image stabilization (OIS), video recording is free from jerkiness or jittering. The 8-megapixel selfie camera is solid."
OnePlus X,"Software, Availability, and Conclusions","The OnePlus X runs Android 5.1.1 Lollipop, with OxygenOS 2.1.2 running on top. Despite being a custom UI, the only pre-installed app is SwiftKey. Aside from that, OxygenOS is mostly stock Android, with some extra features."
OnePlus X,"Software, Availability, and Conclusions","There are gesture controls like double-tap-to-wake, or drawing a circle on the screen to launch the camera. You can also customize the capacitive buttons to carry out similar functions. If you swipe left from the home screen, there's a page that shows your most frequently used apps and contacts. Overall, the additions are genuinely useful, and most Android fans will be pleased."
OnePlus X,"Software, Availability, and Conclusions","The OnePlus X sounds like a pretty great phone, right? So why the relatively average score? Well, it's hard to be overly enthusiastic about a device you might not ever be able to get."
OnePlus X,"Software, Availability, and Conclusions","The phone is available through an invite-only purchase system. OnePlus says that it will only be for the first month, but even after that, the phone won't be readily available outside of weekly flash sales. Considering how the company botched the release of the OnePlus 2 badly enough to issue an apology, I don't have much faith in the invite system. I understand that the company wants to avoid having tons of stock tied up in warehouses, but understanding this doesn't do anything for me when I want to buy a phone right now."
OnePlus X,"Software, Availability, and Conclusions","Still, the OnePlus X is a solid phone for an excellent price. It's easily the best-looking phone you can get for $250, though it falls short of some other unlocked options and misses some LTE bands. The Nexus 5X is more expensive, but it's also more powerful and offers better connectivity options for U.S. users. The OneTouch Idol 3 4.7, meanwhile, offers largely comparable hardware for $70 less. And both devices are much easier to get than the OnePlus X, which could prove to be the deciding factor for many potential buyers."
OnePlus 3,Introduction,"Never settle,"" OnePlus says in its marketing message. But the new OnePlus 3, which offers terrific performance, does indeed make some compromises to hit its $399 price point. That said, there's a lot to recommend here. Most notably, the OnePlus 3 uses Qualcomm's flagship Snapdragon 820 processor, pairing it with 6GB of RAM. As we saw in testing, that makes the phone really, really fast. It's also slim, highly customizable, and has great battery life, which will please you if you're looking for a reasonably priced but powerful unlocked phone."
OnePlus 3,Availability and Physical Features,"The fourth phone in the OnePlus lineup, the OnePlus 3 is also the first one that the company is selling without invitations. That means it'll likely be backordered, but OnePlus says it has worked out the inventory issues it experienced with the original OnePlus One. We're feeling a lot better about the company's ability to actually deliver phones than we used to."
OnePlus 3,Availability and Physical Features,"After a few years of plastic and organic backs, the 5.5-inch OnePlus 3 has gone fully metal. It's a big, flat phone at 6.0 by 2.9 by 0.3 inches (HWD) and 5.6 ounces, taller than the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (which also has a 5.5-inch screen), but smaller and slimmer than the Moto X Pure and the Google Nexus 6P (both of which have 5.7-inch displays)."
OnePlus 3,Availability and Physical Features,"The 5.5-inch 1080p screen is an Optic AMOLED panel. It's noticeably dimmer than the OLED on the Samsung Galaxy S7, and about on par with the HTC 10's LCD. That said, 1080p is a relatively low resolution compared with the Quad HD you get with just about every other major flagship."
OnePlus 3,Availability and Physical Features,"The back of the phone has noticeable antenna lines and an unsightly FCC sticker. There's a USB-C port on the bottom, but it only operates at USB 2.0 speeds. On the side, the most notable innovation is a super-convenient alert slider, which lets you flip over into Priority Alert or Silent Mode easily."
OnePlus 3,Availability and Physical Features,"If you want to switch out the phone's back panel, OnePlus is selling apricot, bamboo, rosewood, sandstone, and carbon fiber cases for $24.95 each, which give the phone a more organic feel. They're nice, though they don't look as integrated as the custom backs for the OnePlus 2."
OnePlus 3,Networking and Call Quality,"The phone's modem works with AT&T and T-Mobile on LTE bands 1/2/4/5/7/12/17/30. The phone supports dual SIMs, which I find a little disappointing because here in the US, we'd rather use that second slot of space for a microSD card. The OnePlus 3 does not have the right bands for Verizon's or Sprint's network."
OnePlus 3,Networking and Call Quality,"Voice quality is very good. I was impressed with the earpiece, which is loud without distorting under high volume transmissions. The speakerphone is also surprisingly loud for a bottom-ported, mono unit—it's usable outdoors, though not if you're surrounded by heavy traffic or construction noise. Transmissions through the mic were very clear when made from a quiet room. From a noisy area, there was some wind noise and distortion in the microphone that increased as noise cancellation ratcheted up, but my voice was still perfectly comprehensible."
OnePlus 3,Networking and Call Quality,"Other radios here include 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.2, NFC, and of course GPS. Both LTE and Wi-Fi performance were not up to Galaxy S7 levels in testing. LTE is limited because the phone's X12 modem has been limited to Category 6, which offers slower speeds than most Snapdragon 820 devices. It also lacks MIMO for Wi-Fi, which generally improves Wi-Fi speeds, especially at the edge of Wi-Fi cells. I got Wi-Fi speeds about half of what I did on the Galaxy S7 in several tests, although range was about the same."
OnePlus 3,"Performance, Software, and Battery","If you put a powerful engine on something light, it'll scream. That's what OnePlus does by pairing a Snapdragon 820 processor with 6GB of RAM and UFS 2.0 flash memory, then fronting them with a mere 1080p display. While there are some other phones available with a Snapdragon 820 and a 1080p screen, this is the first one we've seen in the US, and it's startling what all that horsepower does to performance. Because of the lower-resolution screen and fast flash memory, the OnePlus 3 outperforms the Samsung Galaxy S7, the HTC 10, and other $600-750 phones on benchmarks."
OnePlus 3,"Performance, Software, and Battery","When you're looking at pure processor performance, the OnePlus 3 does pretty much the same as the other flagships—after all, it's the same processor. It's in video and storage where it excels. The phone doubled the Galaxy S7's frame rates on the more intense phases of the GFXBenchmark graphics benchmark, especially the ones that require OpenGL ES 3.1, which is used for the latest games. It also did better than the Galaxy S7 on both Antutu's RAM benchmark and A1 SD Bench's storage benchmark, and the 6GB of RAM means it can flip through more multitasking apps without resetting them than the competing flagships can."
OnePlus 3,"Performance, Software, and Battery","The low-resolution screen also has a positive impact on battery life. In testing, we saw 9 hours and 48 minutes of LTE YouTube streaming on the 3,000mAh battery, which is a bit higher than the Samsung Galaxy S7 (9 hours) and, in general, excellent. Dash Charging, the company's quick charge system, requires that you use a proprietary charger, which is pesky. But using that charger, you can go to 50 percent battery in 25 minutes, and reach a full charge in around 45 minutes."
OnePlus 3,"Performance, Software, and Battery","You can't expand the 64GB of storage, of which 52.6 GB is available, but at least it's fast. As mentioned above, it benchmarked around 50 percent faster than the Galaxy S7's built-in storage for writes using A1 SD Bench."
OnePlus 3,"Performance, Software, and Battery","The OxygenOS skin over Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow is somewhat pointless, but it's also not offensive. It mostly consists of a bunch of tweaks and extra customizations that you can ignore if you like. You can customize your LED notifications, the status bar, the quick settings bar, and how you wake up the phone. The most notable shift from standard Android is the Shelf, a set of widgets on a screen to the left of the main home screen. It's no more useful than another home screen would be. The bootloader is unlocked, so if you feel like hacking the phone, you certainly can."
OnePlus 3,Camera and Video,"Nowadays, taking clear shots in good lighting is par for the course on a flagship phone. The OnePlus 3 passes that initial hurdle without problems. Outdoor shots taken with the 16-megapixel rear camera and the 8-megapixel front camera are rich, sharp, and full of detail, although the Auto HDR mode sometimes makes things a little soft. The same goes for 4K video from the main camera and 1080p video from the front camera, both of which record smoothly at 30 frames per second."
OnePlus 3,Camera and Video,"Things get a little dimmer in low light, as they always do. Indoors, the front camera drops to a 1/33 second virtual shutter speed, so you have to hold it still to prevent blur. Low-light photos from the main camera can also get soft and noisy, although fortunately not blurry. It's no Galaxy S7, but for the price, the OnePlus 3 does very well indeed."
OnePlus 3,Camera and Video,"OnePlus made its own camera app, with a manual mode and shutter speed down to 1/8000 and ISO up to 3200, which is nice. I also found the tap-to-exposure, which works in both still and video modes, smooth and usable."
OnePlus 3,Camera and Video,"The powerful bottom-ported speaker makes the OnePlus 3 good for watching videos. I also played some high-quality HDtracks music files on Bowers & Wilkins P5 Wireless ($150.00 at Amazon) headphones. At maximum volume, the music is a little flatter and not quite as loud as on a Galaxy S7 or especially an HTC 10 (which has a 1-volt headphone amp), but you'd only notice that with high-quality files and high-quality headphones."
OnePlus 3,Comparisons and Conclusions,"The OnePlus 3 is a sleek, powerful Android phone. That's unquestionable. But $400 is an odd price for a phone right now since it's outside the budget realm. Our Editors' Choice budget unlocked phone, the Blu Life One X, costs less than half the OnePlus 3. At the high-end, people are generally demanding super-high-resolution screens and removable memory. The HTC 10, our other unlocked Editors' Choice, is $700 and delivers on those promises, as well as bringing nicer audio, faster Wi-Fi, and a better modem, with all the AT&T bands—as you'd expect from a more expensive phone."
OnePlus 3,Comparisons and Conclusions,"That leaves the OnePlus 3, and a few other potential rivals like the $499 ZTE Axon 7, stuck in the middle. But if you can swing the price, the OnePlus 3 delivers excellent bang for your buck."
OnePlus 3T,Introduction,"Well, that was fast! The OnePlus 3T, available in 64GB ($439) and 128GB ($479) models, has arrived to replace the $399 OnePlus 3, which was just released this summer. With the 3T, you get the very latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor complemented by 6GB of RAM, making the phone one of the fastest we've tested. Camera performance has improved with a higher megapixel front sensor, the already excellent battery life is even longer, and the software remains highly customizable. If you have a OnePlus 3, you'll probably want to hold onto it, but if you're in the market for a new unlocked phone, the OnePlus 3T is a solid alternative to the ZTE Axon 7 and a much more affordable option than the Google Pixel XL ($169.00 at Amazon)"
OnePlus 3T,"Design, Display, and Features","Put the OnePlus 3T ($439.00 at Plusnet Mobile) next to the OnePlus 3 and you won't be able to tell the difference. The two phones are physically identical, sharing the same metal unibody build, and same button and port placement. They can even use the same cases and accessories (including the OnePlus Loop VR headset), and both phones are available in gray or gold, though the gray 3T is slightly darker (pictured below)."
OnePlus 3T,"Design, Display, and Features","Unsurprisingly, the two phones are identically sized at 6.0 by 2.9 by 0.3 inches (HWD) and both weigh 5.6 ounces, putting the 3T in the same size and weight class as phablet-size metal slabs like the Pixel XL (6.1 by 3.0 by 0.3 inches, 5.9 ounces) and the Axon 7 ($350.00 at Amazon) (6.0 by 2.9 by 0.3 inches, 6.2 ounces). I find it a bit too wide and tall to reach everything with my thumb, making it difficult to use with one hand, especially since there's no option to resize the screen."
OnePlus 3T,"Design, Display, and Features","As mentioned, the ports and buttons are the same as those on the OnePlus 3. On the right panel, there's a dual SIM card slot with a power button below it. The bottom has a 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB-C port, and a fairly loud bottom-firing speaker. The left edge houses a handy alert slider letting you quickly and easily switch between Ring, Silent, and Do Not Disturb modes."
OnePlus 3T,"Design, Display, and Features","The display is a 5.5-inch 1,920-by-1,080 Optic AMOLED panel, the same resolution as the previous generation phone's with the same pixel density (401ppi). That means the Quad HD panels on the Axon 7 (538ppi) and Pixel XL (534ppi) are both significantly sharper. It's a pity that given its higher price point, OnePlus chose not to bump up display resolution."
OnePlus 3T,"Design, Display, and Features","That said, the screen is nothing to scoff at. Maximum brightness has been tamped up and color calibration improved. Colors are accurate, but also vivid when using the default sRGB mode, and customization options are available to make color temperature warmer or cooler. Outdoor visibility is excellent thanks to the combination of high maximum brightness and a polarizing layer between the screen and the protective pane of Gorilla Glass 4. Viewing angles are similarly excellent. Using the OnePlus 3T side-by-side with the Pixel XL, I never noticed the difference in display resolution. The one exception is that if you're using a VR headset you'll notice more pixelation on the 3T."
OnePlus 3T,"Design, Display, and Features","On the lip below the display, you'll find a fingerprint scanner that doubles as a capacitive home button with back and recent buttons on either side. There are various programmable functions (launching the camera, opening a previously used app, bringing up voice assistant, etc.) you can enable for each button with either a long press or a double tap. Other customization options include swapping the order of the buttons or turning them off entirely in favor of the on-screen navigation bar."
OnePlus 3T,"Design, Display, and Features","Despite its rich array of features, the OnePlus 3T isn't protected from submersion in water. And while neither the Pixel XL nor the Axon 7 offer this feature, it's becoming more common on flagship phones and would have been a nice addition here."
OnePlus 3T,Network Performance and Connectivity,"As an unlocked phone supporting LTE bands 1/2/4/5/7/12/17/30, the OnePlus 3T shares the same network compatibility as its predecessor, and will work with GSM carriers like AT&T and T-Mobile without any trouble, but unlike the Pixel XL, there's no support for CDMA carriers including Sprint and Verizon. The X12 modem is also limited to the same Category 6 LTE speeds as the OnePlus 3, so in our testing it proved to be slower than the Pixel XL, which can support speeds up to Category 12 (once that kind of coverage exists). That said, network speeds were still good when we tested the phone on AT&T in midtown Manhattan, averaging 15Mbps down. Other connectivity protocols include dual-band Wi-Fi, NFC, and Bluetooth 4.2."
OnePlus 3T,Network Performance and Connectivity,"The phone also supports two SIM cards, allowing us to make calls using two separate phone numbers, a handy feature for work or travel, and one that's fairly uncommon in the US. Unfortunately, the second SIM slot isn't also compatible with microSD cards, which would arguably be more useful for most people."
OnePlus 3T,Network Performance and Connectivity,"Call quality was great in our tests. Transmissions come across with clear and audible tones, with strong noise cancellation that blots out most background noise. Earpiece and speakerphone volume are both quite loud and can be used to carry on a conversation in a noisy environment."
OnePlus 3T,Processor and Battery,"The OnePlus 3T is powered by the very latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor clocked at 2.35GHz, has 6GB RAM and UFS 2.0 flash storage under the hood. All of this makes for one of the fastest phones we've tested. The 3T scored an impressive 159,144 on AnTuTu, which measures overall system performance. It beats the Snapdragon 820-powered OnePlus 3 by a significant amount (141,429), as well as the Axon 7 (141,989). On Geekbench, the 3T has an excellent single core and multi-core scores 1881/4276, outperforming the Pixel XL (1661/4146), though not by very much."
OnePlus 3T,Processor and Battery,"Unsurprisingly, real world use is buttery smooth. Launching apps and multitasking is so quick it feels almost instantaneous, and during testing, I was never able to put the phone under enough strain to make it stutter. Gaming performance is also excellent. Games like GTA San Andreas and Asphalt 8 run without any hint of latency or dropped frames."
OnePlus 3T,Processor and Battery,"Battery life is stellar thanks to the large 3,400mAh cell combined with a relatively undemanding display. The phone outlasted our 10-hour test video in which we stream full-screen video over LTE while set to maximum brightness. At the end of the test, we still had 5 percent charge remaining. That gives the OnePlus 3T one of the longest runtimes among the phones we've tested, matching theSamsung Galaxy S7 Edge ($792.00 at Verizon Wireless) and handily beating the Pixel XL (6 hours, 43 minutes) and the Axon 7 (6 hours) by several hours. Enabling the Battery Saver feature will also improve runtime by turning off vibration, location services, and most background data. And the proprietary Dash Charger allows the phone to be charged to full in less than an hour."
OnePlus 3T,Camera and Video,"The 3T has matching 16-megapixel cameras on the front and the back, but the one on the rear also supports optical image stabilization (OIS) and 4K video recording. Generally, the camera performance of the rear sensor hasn't changed significantly from the OnePlus 3. It's still a fast, crisp shooter outdoors and in other well-lit settings. There's no noise to be found in pictures taken outside, the camera app is quick to launch, and autofocus is fast and accurate."
OnePlus 3T,Camera and Video,"That said, low-light shooting is still not exceptional. While the 3T manages a respectable level of clarity in darker settings, a shootout with the Pixel XL emphasizes its shortcomings. With a 1.12-micron pixel size, the 3T simply can't gather as much light as the larger 1.55-micron pixels on the Pixel XL. That means despite the lack of OIS, the Pixel XL can take clearer, less grainy, and better-lit photos when snapping in Auto HDR mode"
OnePlus 3T,Camera and Video,"The rear sensor is capable of recording video in 4K at 30fps. It's smooth and fairly stable, but in a testament to Google's impressive software optimization, the Pixel XL was more stable during testing despite only offering electronic image stabilization."
OnePlus 3T,Camera and Video,"The quality of the front-facing camera is top notch. Thanks to its high megapixel count, I was able to take some exceptionally crisp selfies and video, and auto exposure adjusted well to account for lighting conditions indoors and outdoors."
OnePlus 3T,Camera and Video,"Overall, the Pixel XL has a better and more reliable sensor, at least with regard to its rear camera and video recording. The 3T can hold its own in daylight shots, though, and it has more options to fine tune photos with manual controls. You can tweak ISO, white balance, focus, shutter speed, and other settings. You can also shoot in Raw for higher quality images."
OnePlus 3T,Software,"The OnePlus 3T comes running Android 6.0.1 Marshmallowwith its OxygenOS skin. It's a bit disappointing the phone doesn't have Nougat yet, but OnePlus has promised it will be coming by the end of the year. OxygenOS live up to its name by being a lightweight skin with a look that should be immediately familiar Nexus users. App icons haven't changed, nor has the notification shade, or app drawer. The only immediately distinguishable difference is that when you swipe left from the home screen you get Shelf, OnePlus' custom home screen. Shelf shows you your favorite apps, most frequent contacts, and recent photos, also giving you the option of adding additional widgets."
OnePlus 3T,Software,"But what really sets apart OxygenOS is its customization options. It offers a built-in manager for themes, custom app icon support, rearrangeable buttons, and different accents and colors for the Settings menu and status bar, including a spiffy-looking dark theme. You can also lock individual apps and require a password or fingerprint verification to unlock them, useful for sensitive selfies. Gesture support is also on board, allowing you to double tap to wake, draw on the screen to open the flashlight and use a three finger swipe to take a screenshot."
OnePlus 3T,Software,"Bloatware is minimal. Swiftkey is integrated as one of the available keyboards (the other is Google's), but the phone asks permission before enabling either. Aside from that, there's a File Manager, Weather app, and Voice Recorder, all of which I found useful. Out of a total of 128GB of storage, 13GB is occupied by the OS and UI, leaving you with 115GB free. It's an ample amount of space, making up for the lack of expandable storage."
OnePlus 3T,Conclusions,"OnePlus has come a long way since the invite only days of the OnePlus One and OnePlus 2 ($299.00 at Plusnet Mobile) . At $440 the OnePlus 3T is the most expensive phone the company has ever made, but it's also the fastest. The smooth performance combined with long-lasting battery life, an improved front camera, and clean and customizable UI make it an excellent choice. However, depending on storage capacity, the ZTE Axon 7 is $40 to $80 less, while offering largely similar performance with a higher-resolution screen, thundering front-facing speakers, and high-quality audio."
OnePlus 3T,Conclusions,"The Google Pixel XL retains its Editors' Choice status for its excellent camera, unbeatable voice assistant, 24/7 live support, and a guarantee of reliable Android updates. But if some of those aspects aren't important to you, then the 3T could be a compelling option, costing nearly half as much with slightly better performance and a much longer battery life."
OnePlus 5,Introduction,"You might be asking yourself, what happened to the OnePlus 4? Worry not, you didn't take a nap and wake up in 2018. The unlocked OnePlus 5 ($479, 64GB/6GB RAM) is the successor to the OnePlus 3T—OnePlus is a Chinese company, and the number 4 is considered unlucky in China, so it is often skipped. You still get many of the same benefits with the OnePlus 5 as you do with other OnePlus phones, including a powerful processor, loads of RAM, solid camera performance, and excellent battery life. But the price point has increased, so the phone doesn't represent quite the same value proposition as earlier models. That said, it's a compelling alternative to expensive flagships like the Samsung Galaxy S8."
OnePlus 5,Design and Physical Features,"Let's get the obvious out of the way. Yes, the OnePlus 5 resembles the iPhone 7 Plus, but so do most phones with dual rear cameras. There's really only so many places you can put things when you're working with a rectangular metal slab, and OnePlus manages to nail the familiar design elements in a classy manner."
OnePlus 5,Design and Physical Features,"Available in Midnight Black (pictured) and Slate Gray, the OnePlus 5 has a sleek metal unibody design that's free from antenna lines. It's smooth and a bit slippery to the touch, but doesn't pick up fingerprints."
OnePlus 5,Design and Physical Features,"The phone measures 6.1 by 2.9 by 0.3 inches (HWD) and tips the scales at a modest 5.4 ounces. It's the slimmest and lightest phone we've seen from the company, weighing just less than the bezel-free Samsung Galaxy S8 (5.9 by 2.7 by 0.3 inches, 5.5 ounces). It's substantially lighter in your pocket than the HTC U11 (6.1 by 3.0 by 0.3 inches, 6.0 ounces) and the ZTE Axon 7 (6.0 by 2.9 by 0.3 inches, 6.2 ounces). I didn't have much difficulty using it with one hand, as a thin bezel makes it easy to reach across."
OnePlus 5,Design and Physical Features,"The right side of the phone holds dual SIM card slots and a power button that launches the camera app when you press it twice. The bottom has a 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB-C charging port, and a modestly loud bottom-firing mono speaker. The left side has a useful alert slider to switch between Ring, Silent, and Do Not Disturb modes."
OnePlus 5,Design and Physical Features,"The fingerprint scanner is below the display—it doubles as a capacitive home button, and is flanked by back and recent buttons. Each button is programmable, with alternate functions available to launch a voice assistant, enable Split Screen mode, or open the notification center. Each button can have a different function enabled for a long press or a double tap. Other customization options include swapping the order of the buttons, or turning them off entirely in favor of an on-screen navigation bar."
OnePlus 5,Design and Physical Features,"One design element to keep in mind is that the OnePlus 5 isn't waterproof, unlike most current flagship phones, so you'll want to keep it dry. Though, according to OnePlus, it should be able to handle the occasional splash."
OnePlus 5,Display,"The display is a 5.5-inch 1,920-by-1,080 AMOLED panel covered in a protective layer of Gorilla Glass 5 that curves to meet the edges. This is the same resolution as the previous model, which is a bit disappointing considering the $400 Axon 7 has a Quad HD panel. Still, it's sharp for the size, with 401 pixels packed into every inch, the same as the iPhone 7 Plus. It just isn't quite as crisp as the Axon 7 (538ppi) or the Galaxy S8 (570ppi)."
OnePlus 5,Display,"The screen does have its strong points, though. The AMOLED panel gives you rich, saturated colors and inky blacks. It gets very bright and I had no difficulty using the phone outdoors in direct sunlight. Color temperature can be customized, with accurate reproduction in the default mode, but options to make it warmer or cooler, and a Night mode that kicks in to help your eyes in the late hours and a Reading mode that sets everything to grayscale. If you're concerned about battery life, you can enable the Dark theme that sets all menu backgrounds to black and saves power by only lighting the pixels you need."
OnePlus 5,Network Performance and Connectivity,"As with every OnePlus phone, the 5 only works on GSM carriers like AT&T and T-Mobile. It supports GSM (850/900/1800/1900MHz), UMTS (1/2/4/5/8), and LTE bands (1/2/3/4/5/7/8/12/17/18/19/20/25/26/28/29/30/34/39/40/41/66). Both US and international versions get the same set of bands, which is useful if you plan on traveling. Because of its Snapdragon 835 processor, the OnePlus 5 comes with an X16 modem, but it's capped at Cat 12 LTE down (600Mbps) and Cat 13 LTE up (150Mbps)."
OnePlus 5,Network Performance and Connectivity,"That means you won't get gigabit speeds (Cat 16) once those networks are up and running. It's not a big deal right now since no carrier has a gigabit network outside of certain test cities, but if you're planning to keep the phone for a couple of years, you won't enjoy faster speeds as they roll out nationally."
OnePlus 5,Network Performance and Connectivity,"That said, network connectivity is only going to be as good as your carrier. In heavily congested midtown Manhattan, I got crawling single digit download speeds on AT&T, which was in line with the Galaxy S8 I was testing at the same time."
OnePlus 5,Network Performance and Connectivity,"Other connectivity protocols supported are NFC, so you can use Android Pay, dual-band Wi-Fi (2.4GHz/5GHz), and Bluetooth 5.0, which pairs with multiple speakers or headphones and improves range, speed, and quality."
OnePlus 5,Network Performance and Connectivity,"Call quality was decent, but nothing to write home about. Earpiece volume is loud and noise cancellation blots out traffic and voices, but wind causes significant crackling. Voices are also on the robotic side."
OnePlus 5,Network Performance and Connectivity,"The phone doesn't support high-resolution audio like the Axon 7, but with wired headphones you do get a built-in audio tuner that provides fine balance controls with equalizer presets for different genres of music and enhancements for certain headphones like the OnePlus Bullets or JBL E1+. Those earphones aren't included, so I wasn't able to test this feature."
OnePlus 5,Processor and Battery,"As mentioned, the OnePlus 5 is powered a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, the same chipset in all current top-tier flagships. It's clocked at 2.45GHz, supports UFS 2.1 flash storage, and comes with either 6GB or 8GB of LPDDR4X RAM (the 8GB model, with 128GB of storage, costs $539). Simply put, it's one of the fastest Android phones we've ever tested."
OnePlus 5,Processor and Battery,"On the AnTuTu benchmark (which only recognized 4GB of RAM as usable) it scored 184,249, surpassing flagships like the U11(175,241) and S8 (158,266) due to the less-demanding 1080p display. On Geekbench, the OnePlus 5 scored 1,971 single-core and 6,764 multi-core, once again outperforming the U11 (1,913/6,538) and S8 (1,836/5,960)."
OnePlus 5,Processor and Battery,"It should go without saying that real-world performance is incredibly smooth. Whether it's multitasking, demanding games like Modern Combat and GTA: San Andreas, or twenty open tabs in Chrome, nothing causes the OnePlus 5 to skip a beat. You likely won't ever need 8GB of RAM, so the 6GB model should be plenty if you want to save some money."
OnePlus 5,Processor and Battery,"Battery life is excellent. The phone clocked 9 hours, 15 minutes when we streamed full-screen video over LTE at maximum screen brightness. That's not quite as long as the OnePlus 3T, which lasted over 10 hours, but it's understandable because battery capacity has been reduced by 100mAh (to 3,300mAh) to accommodate the smaller form factor. The OnePlus 5 is still one of the longest-lasting phones we've tested this year, surpassing the S8 (5 hours, 45 minutes), LG G6 (5 hours, 57 minutes), and U11 (7 hours, 1 minute). Proprietary fast charging juices up the phone to 50 percent in 30 minutes, and 100 percent in a little over an hour, matching Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0."
OnePlus 5,Camera,"The OnePlus 5 has dual rear camera sensors that serve the same purpose as the ones on the iPhone 7 Plus and Asus ZenFone 3 Zoom. You have a 16-megapixel main sensor backed by a wide-angle lens, and a 20-megapixel sensor with a tighter field of view, delivering 1.6x optical zoom with software tweaks to achieve 2.0x lossless zoom. In well-lit conditions, the sensors produce sharp images with crisp details and accurate color reproduction."
OnePlus 5,Camera,"The 20MP telephoto camera maintains a high level of clarity when you zoom in. In the images below, you can see that shots from both lenses are equally sharp, sidestepping the image degradation you'd deal with by utilizing the digital zoom feature on a single-lens phone."
OnePlus 5,Camera,"The difference in zoom quality comes across most clearly between the OnePlus 5 and the Galaxy S8, with the OnePlus 5 showing the individual spines of the plant at the same zoom level."
OnePlus 5,Camera,"In a shootout with the Galaxy S8, the OnePlus 5 holds its own with pictures taken outdoors. In our comparison shots below, both phones capture sharp images outside, with a high degree of overall clarity and minimal noise. But the S8 wins with finer details. The brick work of buildings comes across more clearly, individual leaves are more defined, and objects in the distance are just a bit sharper."
OnePlus 5,Camera,"The contrast is more pronounced in low light. In a series of pictures taken indoors, the S8 pulled ahead with clearer, less blurry images. Because it has optical image stabilization (OIS), the S8 minimizes blur when shooting in dim conditions; the OnePlus 5 uses electronic image stabilization (EIS) to steady shots. The S8's autofocus system is also quicker in dim light."
OnePlus 5,Camera,"The OnePlus 5 can record 4K video at 30fps and 1080p at 60fps. Quality is good, but the lack of OIS comes into play, with video from the OnePlus showing more shake than you get with handheld footage from the Galaxy S8."
OnePlus 5,Camera,"The front-facing 16-megapixel camera delivers excellent image and video quality. Autofocus and autoexposure are both fast and responsive and pictures are crisp. Like the rear camera, the front camera has EIS, letting you take clear and stable 1080p video at 30fps. In low light, pictures sometimes have patches of noise, but you'll encounter the same with the S8."
OnePlus 5,Camera,"Like the S8, the OnePlus 5 has manual controls that let you tweak ISO, white balance, focus, shutter speed, and other settings. You can also shoot in Raw for higher-quality images that can be edited later."
OnePlus 5,Camera,"Overall, the S8 remains the top camera phone on the market right now, especially when it comes to low-light shooting, but the OnePlus 5 isnt too far behind, and quite impressive for the price."
OnePlus 5,Software,"The OnePlus 5 comes running Android 7.1.1 Nougat, the same version you get on the Google Pixel XL. It has OxygenOS on top, a lightweight skin with a design that keeps the clean appearance of stock Android, but adds some extra features. Swiping left from the home screen brings a custom widget screen that shows weather, memos, recent contacts, recently used apps, used storage, data, and battery life. You also have the option of adding additional widgets."
OnePlus 5,Software,"Other customization options include a built-in manager for themes, custom app icon support, rearrangeable buttons, and different accents and colors for the settings menu and status bar. You can also lock individual apps and require a password or fingerprint verification to unlock them. Gestures are supported, allowing you to double tap the phone to wake it, draw on the screen to launch different apps, and use a three-finger swipe to take a screenshot."
OnePlus 5,Software,"Bloatware is minimal. There's a few preinstalled apps, most of which can be deleted. Whether you opt for the 64GB or 128GB version, there's plenty of space for apps, photos, and video. That said, there is no microSD card slot, so storage isn't expandable."
OnePlus 5,Conclusions,"At $539 for the 128GB model and $479 for the 64GB model, the OnePlus 5 is the company's most costly phone yet. But then, in many aspects, you're getting many of the same features you find in phones that cost $200 to $300 more. The OnePlus 5 has the latest Snapdragon 835 processor with plenty of RAM, sharp cameras with optical zoom, and excellent battery life. But there are some caveats. Screen resolution is fine, but not up to par with the competition, there's no waterproofing or expandable storage, and the modem is capped to Cat 12 speeds."
OnePlus 5,Conclusions,"If you want to best of all worlds, the Samsung Galaxy S8 is our Editors' Choice, though it'll cost you a pretty penny more. If you want to save some money, the $400 ZTE Axon 7 remains a great choice. It has a Quad HD display, loud front-facing stereo speakers, high-resolution audio, and runs the latest version of Android. It has a slightly older Snapdragon 820 processor, but that might be a worthwhile trade-off if you prefer the sharper display. If you simply want the fastest performance possible for the best price, however, the OnePlus 5 is an excellent choice."
OnePlus 5T,Introduction,"The OnePlus 5T ($499 for 64GB; $559 for 128GB) is the best phone you can get for $500, but that's slicing the phone market pretty thinly. The latest from the cult unlocked smartphone maker is beautifully built and has the processor power and RAM of phones that cost $300 more. But its modem and main camera are thoroughly midrange, landing it in an awkward zone between less-expensive and more-capable devices on the US market."
OnePlus 5T,Introduction,"To properly understand the OnePlus 5T, you have to shake off its old ""flagship killer"" reputation. The 5T doesn't measure up to actual 2017 flagships like the Samsung Galaxy S8, Samsung Galaxy Note 8, or the iPhone X. Rather, this is a midrange-killer, assassinating devices like the Moto X4, the LG G6, the Essential PH-1, and the HTC U11 Life."
OnePlus 5T,Introduction,"The 5T comes hot on the heels of the OnePlus 5, in OnePlus's second year of a six-month cadence. (Last year, we saw the 3 and the 3T; there was no OnePlus 4.) It shares a processor and modem with the 5, but the screen is upgraded and the camera is changed."
OnePlus 5T,Introduction,"From Apple, you'd consider that an ""S"" release. OnePlus founder Pete Lau joked that S, plus one, is T, and so here we are. Don't assume that OnePlus will have a new phone every six months, he cautioned us. This one just has a screen that he couldn't pass up."
OnePlus 5T,Physical Design,"The OnePlus 5T is very well built. It has a very slim, matte black aluminum unibody, at 6.15 by 2.95 by 0.29 inches (HWD) and 5.7 ounces. It isn't slippery, but you'll still want to put a case on it. The single speaker is on the bottom, along with the USB-C port and standard headphone jack. On the left side, you'll find OnePlus's excellent physical mute slider. The front of the phone is mostly screen."
OnePlus 5T,Physical Design,"The screen is why the OnePlus 5T exists. According to OnePlus execs, they saw the trend towards bigger screens and smaller bezels, so when a 6-inch, 18:9 Samsung AMOLED panel became available, they jumped at the chance to grab it. The 2160-by-1080 panel is 401ppi, which is less dense than other competing phones. They tend to be either higher-resolution, at the same size, or smaller in size, at the same resolution. The result is that icons and UX elements appear physically larger here than on a Galaxy S8 or Moto X4, although you get about the same Web browsing real estate as on the S8, because the physical size of text is the same. The one place you lose is in VR, where the OnePlus 5T isn't compatible with VR headsets, but OnePlus makes the correct point that VR isn't that frequently used nowadays."
OnePlus 5T,Physical Design,"The phone has the brightness, rich colors and wide viewing angles we associate with Samsung AMOLED, as opposed to the lower-quality LG P-OLED we've seen on the Google Pixel 2 XL. If that's too saturated for you, though, you can tune it down to DCI-P3 (like the iPhone) or sRGB (like the Pixel.) Screen images are perfectly viewable outdoors."
OnePlus 5T,Physical Design,"The phone's fingerprint scanner is on the back now, like on LG phones. It's quick and works reliably. That's good, because the phone's face-unlock feature does not work reliably. OnePlus says that it created a proprietary, 2D face-unlock system that is faster and more secure than Google's default face unlock. I found that it didn't work very well off-angle (on a table), or with my eyes closed, or when I was backlit, or sometimes just in general. Most of the time it worked, but it didn't work enough that (unlike with Apple's Face ID) it got on my nerves. Having the fingerprint scanner as a reliable backup was essential."
OnePlus 5T,Physical Design,"Cases are important for phones. Many smaller Android brands, such as ZTE, don't have a broad set of reliable cases. That's a OnePlus strength: the company offers $19.95 screen protectors and $19.95-$29.95 cases in various styles, including silicone, carbon-fiber, and natural woods."
OnePlus 5T,Physical Design,"Unfortunately, the OnePlus 5T is not IP-rated for water resistance. I got very mixed messages on water resistance from OnePlus; I was told that it could be dropped in puddles or handled in the rain, but not dunked. We did not test water resistance because we needed the phone to remain functioning."
OnePlus 5T,Modem and Audio Quality,"OnePlus, unfortunately, cut some corners with the cellular modem. The 5T supports all of AT&T's and T-Mobile's frequency bands except T-Mobile's new rural Band 71. It also supports some Sprint and Verizon LTE bands (including Sprint's band 41, but not Verizon's band 13), but those carriers won't authenticate this phone."
OnePlus 5T,Modem and Audio Quality,"The phone supports 3x carrier aggregation but lacks 4x4 MIMO antennas, so it tops out at 600Mbps down. That's similar to the latest iPhones and most midrange phones, but outpaced by higher-end Android phones."
OnePlus 5T,Modem and Audio Quality,"The phone takes up to two nano-SIMs, but I was disappointed to see that the second slot couldn't be used for a MicroSD card. Dual SIM phones are rare here in the states, but additional storage would have been welcome."
OnePlus 5T,Modem and Audio Quality,"Call quality is good here, but voice coverage will depend on your carrier. The phone supports both Wi-Fi and VoLTE on T-Mobile. Neither option appeared with AT&T or Cricket SIMs. Using the AT&T 3G network, the earpiece was loud, and the speakerphone was sharp and clear. The speakerphone mix doesn't kill all the background noise, but my voice was nicely detected and pushed far forward of any background noise."
OnePlus 5T,Modem and Audio Quality,"The 5T supports Bluetooth 5.0 and had no trouble pairing with my Plantronics Voyager Focus UC. If you play high-quality music files, though, make sure to delve into the settings and switch the codec from SBC to the higher-quality AptX HD. The single speaker isn't amazing, but at least it doesn't distort at high volumes the way the Moto X4's does."
OnePlus 5T,Modem and Audio Quality,"Battery life was very good, at 7 hours, 10 minutes of LTE video streaming with the screen on full brightness. Unfortunately, that's two hours less than the OnePlus 5's runtime (9 hours, 15 minutes), likely due to the increased screen size. It'll still last longer than the S8 though (5 hours, 45 minutes). OnePlus's quick ""Dash Charging"" lives up to its billing, too. I got from 0 to 40% in 20 minutes, and to 79% in 45 minutes, with the phone off. If you have other phones around, be aware that OnePlus's dash charger, included with the phone, is just an ordinary non-quick charger when used with other phones, and non-OnePlus chargers won't quick-charge the phone."
OnePlus 5T,Modem and Audio Quality,"The phone also doesn't have wireless charging, but honestly, after six months of using a Galaxy S8 with wireless charging, I still see it as a disposable frill. I'm okay with leaving it out on this midrange phone."
OnePlus 5T,Oxygen OS and Performance,"OnePlus's Oxygen OS skin over Android 7.1.1 Nougat focuses on speed and customizability. (The company says that an Android Oreo update will come during the first quarter of 2018.) Its benchmarks tend to match other Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 phones, especially if they're in 1080P resolution mode: its 169,703 score on Antutu, for instance, it very similar to the Moto Z2 Force and the Google Pixel 2, and just a bit behind the Galaxy Note 8 and LG V30."
OnePlus 5T,Oxygen OS and Performance,"On-screen gaming frame rates are also on par with high-end peers at the same resolution. The Galaxy Note 8 only scores 13 fps in the GFXBench Car Crash test, compared to the OnePlus's 23 fps, but knock the Note 8 down to 1080p and it's on par."
OnePlus 5T,Oxygen OS and Performance,"The thing is, though, this is the least expensive Snapdragon 835 phone out there. At its price level, the OnePlus 5T is competing with the Moto X4 and HTC U11 Life, both of which manage around 70,000 on Antutu, and the LG G6, which gets 135,000. The OnePlus 5T's GPU has at least double the performance of any of those phones, which you definitely feel in action and driving games; the game Breakneck, for instance, had more sensitive controls on the OnePlus 5T than on the Moto X4. So you're getting a heck of a lot of processor for your money."
OnePlus 5T,Oxygen OS and Performance,"The same goes for RAM. The 5T comes in two models, with 6GB and 8GB of RAM, and 64GB or 128GB of storage. That means more flipping in and out of apps without watching them restart than on other phones, which is especially relevant if you do a lot of gaming. Our 128GB test phone has 111GB free."
OnePlus 5T,Oxygen OS and Performance,"Oxygen OS, itself, doesn't get in your way. It looks and feels like stock Android, with a bunch of little customizations that you can use or ignore. The most useful is ""parallel apps,"" which lets you create a second, virtual installation of some popular apps so you can have two accounts available. It works with Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook Messenger, Twitter, Skype, and Whatsapp."
OnePlus 5T,Oxygen OS and Performance,"OnePlus has a vibrant user community, a vigorous beta program, and an invasive data collection system telling the company what people are doing with their phones. After some controversy, the ""user experience program"" is still opt-in, although you can opt out in the Settings menu."
OnePlus 5T,Oxygen OS and Performance,"And if you don't like Oxygen OS at all, OnePlus is probably the most hacker-friendly mainstream Android brand; the company confirmed that the phone's bootloader is unlocked, and you can install whatever ROM you like."
OnePlus 5T,Cameras,"OnePlus does some odd things with the cameras this time around. On the back of the phone, there's a main 16-megapixel, f/1.7 camera but also a 20-megapixel, f/1.7 camera that's supposed to be for low light. The front camera is an excellent 16-megapixel, f/2 selfie shooter."
OnePlus 5T,Cameras,"The philosophy around the camera is a little perplexing. The secondary camera is supposed to kick in for scenes below 10 lux, using 4:1 pixel binning to provide a brighter, 5-megapixel image. That's totally not what it does in practice."
OnePlus 5T,Cameras,"First of all, 10 lux is really dim. Indoor scenes are far more than 10 lux; even a darkened bowling alley, where we tested the camera, was at about 30 lux. So it can be hard to get the secondary camera to trigger in the first place, especially because you can't turn it on manually."
OnePlus 5T,Cameras,"The secondary camera also delivers 20MP files. OnePlus says it bins the image down to 5MP and then re-expands the file to 20MP, which introduces a lot of visible artifacting. And because of software which prioritizes higher shutter speeds over viewable images, the photos can still look very dim, especially compared to the latest Galaxies or the Pixel 2."
OnePlus 5T,Cameras,"Here's where ""what you're comparing it with"" matters a lot. Against the $649 Pixel 2 and $720 Galaxy S8 the 5T has unimpressive low light performance. But the 5T crushes the $400 Moto X4 in low light. In our super-low-light test, we could make out details in the 5T's image that were swallowed up in dimness on the X4."
OnePlus 5T,Cameras,"In good light, the main camera also falls between the Moto X4 and the Galaxy S8/Note 8. Yes, there are more pixels than on the 12-megapixel Samsung phones, but that didn't result in more sharpness and detail, just more artifacting. The software bias towards higher shutter speeds didn't necessarily help here either, as some outdoor HDR photos turned out a little darker than I'd like."
OnePlus 5T,Cameras,"The 16-megapixel, f/2.0 front camera destroys the X4's front shooter. It delivers richer color, more realistic detail, and collects considerably more light. It takes flashless, low-light shots in darkened rooms that just get swallowed up in mud on the X4."
OnePlus 5T,Cameras,"The dual cameras enable the usual gimmicky bokeh 'portrait mode' in its most basic form, without the after-the-fact focus editing of the Galaxy Note 8 or the iPhone's range of lighting effects. Using the second camera slot for the 'low light' camera also means you don't get wide-angle (like on the X4 and LG G6) or 2x zoom (like on the Note 8 and iPhone) options. There's a confusing '2X' button in the camera UI, but it just activates digital zoom, with all the usual digital zoom artifacting."
OnePlus 5T,Cameras,"OnePlus's ""electronic image stabilization"" stays with the theme of ""not as good as a flagship, but better than nothing."" When recording 4K video, you can see the EIS smoothing out video through a slight pulsing as it constantly corrects the video. It's nowhere near as smooth, calm or fluid as the OIS on a Galaxy Note 8, but it's less jittery than no stabilization at all."
OnePlus 5T,Cameras,"None of this should be too shocking; it's just reality. There are no shortcuts. The OnePlus 5T has the best camera you can get in a $500 phone, but it doesn't measure up to phones that cost more."
OnePlus 5T,Comparisons and Conclusions,"There's an 'uncanny valley' in phone pricing in the US. We buy a lot of phones that cost less than $400, but if we're going to spend $500, pretty often we spend $700, especially if that $700 phone comes with a monthly payment plan."
OnePlus 5T,Comparisons and Conclusions,"The OnePlus 5T falls smack into that uncanny valley. If you're looking for a big screen at a reasonable price, there's nothing quite like it. But OnePlus's price creep has made its phones steadily less attractive compared with higher-end competitors. The OnePlus One cost $299. The OnePlus 3 cost $399; the OnePlus 5 cost $479, and now we're up to $499 and $559."
OnePlus 5T,Comparisons and Conclusions,"The $649 Google Pixel 2 and the $720 Samsung Galaxy S8 both have better cameras and modems (although they offer less storage and RAM), and they support all four major US carriers. If you intend to spend more than the $400 for a Moto X4, you're likely to be picking up one of those on a monthly payment plan from a carrier or major retailer. There's no payment plan for the OnePlus 5T; you have to buy it up front."
OnePlus 5T,Comparisons and Conclusions,"The 5T sets the bar for a $500 phone, to be sure. There's no $500 phone that performs like this. But not many Americans are looking for a $500 phone, per se. Unless the screen size here calls out to you, the superior camera and network performance on the Pixel 2 or Galaxy S8 will probably do you better."
OnePlus 6,Introduction,"The OnePlus 6 grows on you. At first we were a little turned off by its $529 starting price, but the cult smartphone maker's latest device won us over with its elegant software, a combination of Google apps and quiet, thoughtful additions. A top-of-the-line Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor and excellent camera performance sweeten the deal. The OnePlus 6 is definitely the best $500-ish unlocked phone on the market. The problem is, few people in the US are really shopping for an unlocked phone in the $500 range."
OnePlus 6,Pricing,"The phone comes in three models. For $529, you get 64GB of storage and 6GB of RAM in midnight black (which has a more matte effect), mirror black (which has a glossy finish), or white. For $579, it's 128GB of storage and 8GB of RAM in all three colors. For $629, it's 256GB of storage and 8GB of RAM, in midnight black only. We reviewed the $579 model in mirror black."
OnePlus 6,Pricing,"That's definitely good value for the money. But Americans who pay more than $400 for phones tend to use monthly payment plans, and OnePlus doesn't offer one. T-Mobile's Samsung Galaxy S9 isn't really $720 for most people: It's $30 per month. That means many people won't see OnePlus 6, in their day to day, as cheaper than the Galaxy S9 or the LG G7."
OnePlus 6,Shut Up About the Notch,"We have one complaint about the OnePlus 6's otherwise excellent body: It's a little too wide. In an era of 18:9 and 18.5:9 phones that make six-inch screens comfortable to use with just one hand, OnePlus has gone with a 6.28-inch, 19:9, 2,280-by-1,080 design, making its phone 2.96 inches wide. That's noticeably wider than the Samsung Galaxy S9 (2.70 inches) and the LG G7 (2.83 inches), and you can feel it in the OnePlus 6 being harder to hold and use with one hand."
OnePlus 6,Shut Up About the Notch,"The OnePlus 6's most controversial feature is obvious when you turn it on: Its screen has a notch. That has driven some OnePlus fans absolutely insane on social media—not really around the functionality of the screen, but cultural anger that their phones may be tainted with an idea associated with Apple. They should get over it. The notch at the top of the screen isn't a problem, because of OnePlus' smart software choices. Within a few seconds, we had turned the notch into a dedicated status bar rather than having content flowing into it, and that approach looks great."
OnePlus 6,Shut Up About the Notch,"The phone has Gorilla Glass 5 on its front and back. We tested the glossy black model, which definitely picks up more fingerprints than the matte black one. OnePlus is also doing its usual excellent lineup of cases, including wood, fabric, and carbon fiber options."
OnePlus 6,Shut Up About the Notch,"Otherwise, the body is all rounded edges, no sharp corners. It doesn't come to a point on the sides the way the latest Galaxy phones do, and OnePlus is still using a flat rather than a curved screen. But the package shape, while somewhat generic, is elegant."
OnePlus 6,Shut Up About the Notch,"The AMOLED screen is terrific. Yes, it isn't as dense as a quad-HD screen, but that's hard to tell unless you're comparing it side-by-side with a sharper display. The brightness and color saturation here really jump out at you."
OnePlus 6,Shut Up About the Notch,"The phone still has the OnePlus mute slider, which has always been great, as well as a regular headphone jack. The single, bottom-ported speaker is fine, but easy to cover with your hand. The body is weather-resistant, but not waterproof. It has a 3,300mAh battery with OnePlus' Dash Charging feature for fast charging. It lasted for 5 hours, 49 minutes of LTE video playback in our battery rundown test. That's fine, but falls short of the LG G7 (6+ hours) and the Samsung Galaxy S9 (9+ hours)."
OnePlus 6,Shut Up About the Notch,"There's no microSD card slot in the OnePlus 6, so you get your 64GB, 128GB, or 256GB of internal storage and that's it. The 128GB model ships with 116GB available."
OnePlus 6,Networking and Call Quality,"The OnePlus 6 has excellent call quality. Both the earpiece and speakerphone are louder than we expected, and noise cancellation through the microphone is excellent. The phone supports HD calling, as well as the new EVS codec for the best possible calls on T-Mobile. Voice-over-IP and voice-over-WiFi are supported for T-Mobile, but not AT&T. (AT&T uses its 3G network to make calls.) The bottom-ported speakerphone is highly directional, and maybe a little too easy to cover with your hand, but it's a pretty common placement. The physical lock switch on the side flips between ring, vibrate, and silent, a nice touch."
OnePlus 6,Networking and Call Quality,"Networking options are good but don't quite match up to the leaders. The OnePlus 6 has dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi. Tested against a Samsung Galaxy S9+ on a 150Mbps connection, we found the OnePlus 6 got consistently slightly lower speeds than the S9+ at various distances from the router, but slightly greater range. The phone has Bluetooth 5.0 with aptX for lossless music playback."
OnePlus 6,Networking and Call Quality,"The state-of-the-art Qualcomm X20 modem here isn't being used to its maximum capacity, but it's still great. It has all of the frequency bands that AT&T and T-Mobile use, except LAA, which boosts speeds in certain very crowded urban locations. With 256QAM encoding and 4x4 MIMO, it is gigabit LTE capable. Even though it supports many of their LTE and CDMA bands, the phone does not work on Verizon or Sprint. We put some Verizon and Sprint SIM cards in the phone, and they wouldn't connect."
OnePlus 6,Networking and Call Quality,"The OnePlus 6 is a relatively rare dual-SIM phone in the US. Only about four percent of US phones can take two SIM cards, and the feature is useful for international travelers and for folks who want to keep business and personal lines on the same device."
OnePlus 6,Networking and Call Quality,"We loaded two T-Mobile SIMs into the phone and found that we could make calls on, and send and receive texts from both SIMs easily. A toggle in settings let us pick the SIM used for LTE data."
OnePlus 6,Processor and Software,"The phone is based on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor and runs Android 8.1 with OnePlus' Oxygen OS overlay, a very well-designed, spare skin that adds some useful features without much visual guff. The Android P beta is already available for the OnePlus 6."
OnePlus 6,Processor and Software,"Pairing a 1080p screen with the 845 processor makes the phone feel very, very fast. Its PCMark Work score of 8484 is the highest we've seen so far—only the Sony Xperia XZ2, which combines a similar screen resolution and processor, comes close (8306). Graphics benchmarks tell the same story, with 33fps on the GFXBench Car Chase benchmark, matching the Sony and outpacing everyone else. You may lose a little screen sharpness here over devices like the Galaxy S9, but you gain performance."
OnePlus 6,Processor and Software,There's only one bloatware app—the OnePlus Community—and a widget screen to the left of the main home screen with a surprisingly useful loyalty-card-storing app on it.
OnePlus 6,Processor and Software,"Otherwise, you have a pretty pure Android app experience, with Google's photos, messaging, calendar and email clients as the default, and no manufacturer-offered duplicates. Oxygen's tweaks are under the hood, like a gaming setting that turns on do-not-disturb mode, a reading mode that turns the screen more yellow, and the notch-as-status-bar mode we mentioned above. Double tapping the power button opens the camera."
OnePlus 6,Processor and Software,"The software doesn't visually throw elbows in your face the way many other Android skins do. It all feels, well, peaceful. It's very similar to Motorola's approach, except that Motorola charges $700+ for its flagship phone, while this one costs $529."
OnePlus 6,Camera and Multimedia,"The camera pairs a primary Sony 16MP, f/1.7 main shooter with OIS, and a second 20MP secondary lens. Unfortunately, the second lens is mostly wasted. It's for bokeh only. It isn't 2x or wide-angle, and it doesn't appear to help with AR apps. OnePlus either should have made the secondary camera more functional, or saved its (and your) money."
OnePlus 6,Camera and Multimedia,"This complaint aside, the OnePlus 6 takes great, crisp shots in good lighting. It focuses fast, there's little to no noise, and colors are rich. That's standard fare for just about any high-end phone these days, so the real measure of its performance comes from its low-light abilities. In a shootout with the Samsung Galaxy S9+ and the LG G7, the OnePlus 6 delivered solid results, often outshining the G7 and comparing favorably with the S9+ in certain circumstances."
OnePlus 6,Camera and Multimedia,"In the first picture below, taken indoors, the OnePlus 6 does a good job of taking a crisp shot despite the inconsistent lighting, capturing details and textures. It does feel a little oversharpened, though. The G7 smooths things out a bit too much, and seems a little noisy. The Galaxy S9+ arguably takes the best low-light indoor shots of the three. That said, it's close."
OnePlus 6,Camera and Multimedia,"Outdoors, low-light shooting could a bit inconsistent for all three phones. In the first image below, the S9+ takes a clearer and better-lit shot than the others, with the autoexposure doing a better job of handling focus and lighting. The G7 autoexposure struggles to balance lighting, while the OnePlus 6 falls in the middle. In the second picture of the tree, however, the S9+ shots looks a little hazy, but does a better job of capturing the leaves that come out muddy on the OnePlus 6 and G7."
OnePlus 6,Camera and Multimedia,"Overall, the OnePlus 6 is more than capable of holding its own in the camera department. As for the secondary sensor, it provides a heavily oversaturated bokeh effect that contrasts with the more realistic appearance of photos taken with the S9+."
OnePlus 6,Camera and Multimedia,"OnePlus' Pro mode gives you easy access to virtual aperture and shutter speed. The phone is capable of recording 4K video at both 30fps and 60fps, though with the latter you can only take five minutes' worth of video at a time. It's smooth and stable, perhaps a little too smooth. Panning around when recording at 60fps gives a slight soap opera effect."
OnePlus 6,Camera and Multimedia,"The 480fps slow-mo feature, like the 1080p screen, focuses on usability rather than hitting the maximum spec possible. Yeah, sure, it isn't 960fps like on the Galaxy S9+. But it can also record more than 0.2-second at a time, which is nice if you don't have a tightly contained burst of action you want to capture."
OnePlus 6,Camera and Multimedia,"The 16MP f/2 front camera is good. Like the rear sensor, it favors brighter, saturated colors. It captures plenty of detail in daylight, though it shoots a little soft in low light."
OnePlus 6,Conclusions,"The OnePlus 6 stands almost alone in our market as a $529 dual-SIM phone. Its major competition in that role is the Huawei Honor View 10, which has a microSD card slot, an IR blaster and a 2x zoom camera, but choppier gaming performance and a much heavier, more divisive Android skin. OnePlus' software, ultimately, will lead to happier users."
OnePlus 6,Conclusions,"The OnePlus 6 gets all the basics right, including excellent call quality, a solid camera, a loud speaker, a bright screen, and the best chipset on the market. In a not-terribly-exciting year for smartphones, that fits the bill, and OnePlus' software seals the deal."
OnePlus 6,Conclusions,"But a $529/$579 phone is too expensive for the American up-front buyer. I've felt that way since the OnePlus 5, which breached the $400 barrier. Above that level, most people pay with credit, and folks with credit on hand will likely lean towards the Google Pixel 2, the LG G7, or the Samsung Galaxy S9, all of which have similar performance and somewhat more hand-friendly bodies."
OnePlus 6,Conclusions,"Compared with the S9 and the G7, the OnePlus 6 has more RAM, but the lack of a microSD slot, the slightly bloated width, and the superfluous dual camera feel a bit off. The S9 and the G7 are also compatible with all four major US carriers; OnePlus is still AT&T/T-Mobile only."
OnePlus 6,Conclusions,"The equation will be different in countries where most phones are sold up-front, where the small steps down from the S9 to the OnePlus 6 don't justify the $200 price difference; apples to apples, the OnePlus 6 is a better value. Here in the US, a carrier partnership and monthly payment plan for the OnePlus 6 could help even the score."
OnePlus 6,Conclusions,"You can't deny that this phone is elegant, and OnePlus' Android skin might be the best one out there: It adds features quietly, without slowing down the phone or making things look less Googly. The OnePlus community is powerful and positive, making it another good reason to stick with the brand. We just wish that this device fit better into the way Americans shop for phones."
OnePlus 6T,Introduction,"The OnePlus 6T has something no other phone has. Its cool under-display fingerprint sensor might be the end of the notch trend. But even more importantly, the phone has something no OnePlus phone has ever had: a carrier partner. The $579 6T will be sold in T-Mobile stores around the country, and it'll be sold with a monthly payment plan. The 8GB/128GB model is $23.34 on a two-year plan, putting it in the same range as Apple's iPhone XR on a three-year plan ($20.81). T-Mobile will further discount it with a trade-in deal lowering the price to $11.67/month, or $280 total, a tremendous value."
OnePlus 6T,Introduction,"There's going to be a theme in this review. As I tested the OnePlus 6T, it generally came in just a little bit behind much more expensive phones like the Google Pixel 3 and the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 on various measurements. But that's the thing: It's just a little bit behind, often not enough to notice in real life, and it costs a lot less. That unbeatable value makes it an Editors' Choice."
OnePlus 6T,"Pricing, Plans, and Sales","Flagship phones have been getting more expensive this year. Last year's success of the iPhone X made everyone else think they can sell large phones for $1,000, and so here we are, with $1,000 phones. In that context, the base model $549 OnePlus 6T is as radically inexpensive as the $299 OnePlus One was back when flagships cost $650."
OnePlus 6T,"Pricing, Plans, and Sales","The phone comes in four models and two finishes. A 6GB/128GB (108GB available), unlocked, dual-SIM model costs $549. An 8GB/128GB model, for $579, comes both in a dual-SIM model sold independently, and a single-SIM model sold by T-Mobile. Finally, an 8GB/256GB model costs $629. The phone doesn't have a microSD card slot for expandable memory, but 128GB should be plenty. As for colors, you can have any color you want as long as it's black, but at least there are matte and glossy options."
OnePlus 6T,"Pricing, Plans, and Sales","The unlocked phone will work on AT&T, T-Mobile, and, for the first time, Verizon. You can't just pop a Verizon SIM in—you have to ask customer service to activate the phone—but both Verizon and OnePlus promise, officially, it will work. Verizon compatibility makes it a great replacement phone for folks who don't want to get attached to a new 24-month payment plan. The vast majority of 6Ts in the US, though, will likely be sold on payment plans by T-Mobile."
OnePlus 6T,Physical Form,"The 6T, like most phones today, is a flat, black slab. At 6.18 by 2.94 by 0.32 inches (HWD) and 6.42 ounces, it's a little bit wider than I prefer, but narrower than the Google Pixel 3 XL, the iPhone XR, or the Galaxy Note 9. It's certainly the smallest phone I can think of that sports a 6.41-inch screen."
OnePlus 6T,Physical Form,"The AMOLED screen is bright and well-balanced. At 2,340 by 1,080 pixels and 402ppi, it's lower-resolution than some of its competitors, but not so much that you notice (It's still higher density than the iPhone XR, if you're keeping score). Perhaps responding to critiques of OLED color saturation, it asks you to set up a color space when you first start up the phone—sRGB, DCI-P3, adaptive, or custom. The screen has a small notch at the top, because nobody's figured out how to put a front-facing camera under a display yet."
OnePlus 6T,Physical Form,"We're all going to mourn the consumer-unfriendly loss of the headphone jack. Yes, this is becoming a mainstream thing now, but no, I don't know anyone who likes it. OnePlus said that getting rid of the jack let it get the fingerprint scanner into its place, along with a larger 3,700mAh battery."
OnePlus 6T,Physical Form,"As with previous phones, the 6T has neither wireless charging nor is it waterproof. Wireless charging, I can take or leave wireless charging, but OnePlus should really get on board with waterproofing phones like everyone else is doing."
OnePlus 6T,Physical Form,"Unboxing the phone is unusually delightful. There are a lot of little surprises. I don't usually see phones come with a ""handwritten"" letter from the CEO in the box, or with a case. The 6T also comes with a special Dash Charger and a USB-C-to-3.5mm dongle. Only a pair of USB-C headphones would have made the experience perfect; those sell for $20 extra."
OnePlus 6T,Fingerprint Sensor,"The blockbuster feature here, of course, is the in-display optical fingerprint sensor, the first we've seen on a US phone. OnePlus said it's not using the same technology as Vivo did in its NEX S—although the sensor is still optical rather than infrared, it's faster than the Vivo's with a 0.35-second capture time."
OnePlus 6T,Fingerprint Sensor,"The in-display fingerprint sensor isn't actually connected to making the notch smaller, as it would be on an iPhone. Much of the iPhone's notch size comes from its infrared structured-light sensor, used for Face ID. An in-display fingerprint sensor, the thinking goes, would let Apple get rid of that camera and shrink its notch. But the OnePlus 6's notch was just the front-facing camera and proximity sensor, which have been squeezed into the smaller 6T notch. In this case, the fingerprint sensor just lets OnePlus say that it's on the cutting edge—as well as letting you wake up the phone with your fingerprint without flipping it over."
OnePlus 6T,Fingerprint Sensor,"When you wake up the phone, either by tapping on it or twisting it, a green fingerprint appears on the screen. That's the sensor area. You have to press the pad of your finger onto the zone, and keep it there for a little bit of time. Wet thumbs don't work, and the sensor feels more finicky than a physical sensor because it doesn't have the physical lip to guide your finger; it's easier to mis-press the sensor or press it off-center, resulting in a failed authentication."
OnePlus 6T,Fingerprint Sensor,"Here's the thing, though: The sensor gets better with time. According to OnePlus, it learns as you press it more and more often, and becomes more accurate."
OnePlus 6T,Fingerprint Sensor,"The phone also has face unlock, which helps speed things up further. With both of them turned on, the fingerprint sensor becomes more for making purchases and authenticating accounts, situations where you're more likely to be doing a thoughtful, deliberate press on the sensor anyway."
OnePlus 6T,Networking and Call Quality,"The 6T, like the OnePlus 6, supports gigabit LTE on all of AT&T's, T-Mobile's, and Verizon's frequency bands (It actually includes all of Sprint's bands as well, but it won't authenticate onto Sprint's network). The phone's Qualcomm X20 modem is tuned for Cat 16, gigabit speeds, as opposed to the 1.2Gbps Cat 18 speeds in the Samsung Galaxy Note 9. The phone supports 5x carrier aggregation and 4x4 MIMO, state-of-the-art features that will have more of an effect on the quality of an average day's reception than peak speeds will (The main difference between Cat 16 and Cat 18 is whether 4x4 MIMO can be applied to two or three bands of spectrum at once)."
OnePlus 6T,Networking and Call Quality,"The phone is certified on Verizon's network, and should work with Verizon after a call to tech support. From what I understand, OnePlus doesn't intend to sell a lot of phones to Verizon consumers—it's using the 6T as a way to learn about Verizon's certification processes, with the intent to try to get a 5G phone sold by the carrier next year."
OnePlus 6T,Networking and Call Quality,"I decided to test the unlocked, dual-SIM OnePlus 6T on T-Mobile-based virtual carrier Ting. Ting's setup process went decently, although I hit a roadblock when I had to input arcane APN settings myself, something that doesn't happen with larger carriers."
OnePlus 6T,Networking and Call Quality,"I'm testing the 6T's signal reception now, but I think it will be on par with other Snapdragon 845-based devices—in other words, good. Other networking stats are state of the art, of course. There's 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5, GPS, and NFC."
OnePlus 6T,Networking and Call Quality,"Using Ting over T-Mobile's network in Manhattan, I got very good speeds on the 6T. They weren't quite up to those of the Pixel using a T-Mobile SIM, but they were plenty good enough. The 6T on Ting scored between 49 to 62Mbps in a good signal location in Midtown and 10Mbps in a difficult signal location, where the Pixel on T-Mobile got 64 to 80Mbps and 17Mbps respectively."
OnePlus 6T,Networking and Call Quality,"Call quality is rock-solid. The 6T, like other Snapdragon 845-based devices, supports the EVS codec for the highest possible voice quality on T-Mobile and Verizon. The earpiece gets quite loud without distorting. The phone supports voice-over-LTE on T-Mobile and Verizon, but not AT&T, because AT&T reserves that feature for its branded phones."
OnePlus 6T,Networking and Call Quality,"The 6T has a single, bottom-ported speaker, unlike the dual speakers on more expensive competitors like the Pixel 3 XL and Galaxy Note 9. Unsurprisingly, it sounds tinnier, but it's perfectly loud and good enough for conference calls."
OnePlus 6T,Software and Performance,"The OnePlus 6T runs Android 9.0 Pie with OnePlus' simple, tasteful OxygenOS extensions. OnePlus has been pretty good with Android updates; it's promising Android 9 for phones all the way back to the OnePlus 3, so you should expect to get Android 10 and even Android 11 on this device eventually."
OnePlus 6T,Software and Performance,"OxygenOS doesn't have an always-on display mode; it shows the time and notifications when you move the phone or tap the screen, to save battery. Other good, hidden touches include an ""app locker"" to put specific apps behind a password, and ""parallel apps"" to let you spawn multiple social media identities for apps that don't typically allow them."
OnePlus 6T,Software and Performance,"The software modifications are tuned for speed, and the 6T benchmarks better than any phone other than the Pixels or the souped-up Razer Phone 2. We got 8651 on PCMark, as compared with 9191 on the Pixel 3 XL, but 7947 on the LG V40 and 7662 on the Samsung Galaxy Note 9. Graphics feel extra snappy because of the 1080p screen. Like other 1080p Snapdragon 845-based phones, the 6T got 31fps on the GFXBench Car Chase onscreen benchmark; phones with 2K screens tend to get 20 to 22fps."
OnePlus 6T,Software and Performance,"I hate comparing speeds here with phones which cost $300 more. So what else is around $550 at T-Mobile? Well, the LG G7 ThinQ and the Samsung Galaxy S8 both cost $600. The Galaxy S8 gets 6905 on PCMark and 12fps in that onscreen graphics benchmark. The G7 gets 7983 and 22fps. The OnePlus 6T is significantly faster than any other phone in its price bracket."
OnePlus 6T,Software and Performance,"8GB of RAM is a lot more than you get on other $600 phones—both the LG G7 and Galaxy S8 have 4GB—and that means multitasking is richer and more responsive, especially if you're switching between games and other apps."
OnePlus 6T,Software and Performance,"The 6T's 3,700mAh battery powers the huge screen for a decent amount of time—8 hours, 31 minutes in our test. The battery test results are shorter than the Galaxy Note 9's 12-plus hours, but longer than the latest iPhones. The 6T can be fast-charged using OnePlus' proprietary 20W Dash Charge adapter, but only with that adapter."
OnePlus 6T,The Camera: Good Enough,"The Google Pixel 3 has the best smartphone camera around. But the OnePlus 6T's camera is also very good, and the 6T costs a lot less. That's the theme, right?"
OnePlus 6T,The Camera: Good Enough,"The 6T has a 16-megapixel f/2 front-facing camera, along with 16-megapixel and 20-megapixel f/1.7 rear-facing cameras. Unfortunately, the dual rear-facing cameras aren't used for zoom or wide angle like they are on the iPhone XS or the LG V40; they're just combined to make better images."
OnePlus 6T,The Camera: Good Enough,"The images themselves are very good, but not the best. I compared them with a Pixel 3 and an iPhone XR. Outdoors or in good light, the OnePlus does a little bit more sharpening than the Pixel does. That means better-defined brickwork, for instance, but some slightly visible artifacts when photographing clouds."
OnePlus 6T,The Camera: Good Enough,"In indoor light, the 6T's slightly sharper images are actually more pleasing to me—there's a threshold around the level of living-room-at-night light where the Pixel begins to fuzz out a bit with noise, but OnePlus images remain clear. In very low light, the Pixel's intense focus on computational photography comes to the fore, and delivers richer colors than the OnePlus (The Pixel's lead will likely extend with its upcoming Night Sight feature). I judged the XR's photos to be the worst of the three in low light."
OnePlus 6T,The Camera: Good Enough,"While the 6T's front-facing camera isn't bad by any means, both the Pixel and the iPhone deliver slightly warmer skin tones. The Pixel's front-facing camera also does much better than the 6T's in low light, with the OnePlus camera sometimes getting very noisy as it struggled to keep up."
OnePlus 6T,The Camera: Good Enough,"The camera does hardware bokeh with the main camera, and software bokeh with the front camera. It has a night mode, which I didn't find to make a huge difference. It records 4K videos at up to 60 frames per second, and has super-slow-mo at up to 480 frames per second."
OnePlus 6T,The Camera: Good Enough,"I love the look of Pixel camera photos. But in testing I was never worried the OnePlus was letting me down. It's very much a question of what's good enough, and the 6T is definitely good enough."
OnePlus 6T,Conclusions,"The OnePlus 6T is the best value for the money in the US phone market today. It's easily comparable with the $799, 128GB iPhone XR; the $999, 128GB Google Pixel 3 XL; and other phones in the $900 to $1,000 range. But it starts at only $549, and even less with T-Mobile's trade-in deal."
OnePlus 6T,Conclusions,"The phone delivers slightly less performance than the Pixel 3 all around, that's true. But the Pixel 3 costs at least $300 more, a huge price difference for a few more features. Of course, it's not worth upgrading from the OnePlus 6. The OnePlus 6 is six months old. But there's a big leap forward in speed and camera quality from the OnePlus 5 and older phones, that's for sure."
OnePlus 6T,Conclusions,"Now that the OnePlus 6T is being sold by T-Mobile and it's compatible with Verizon, it's the best buy around. It's fast, functional, and a great value. That makes it our Editors' Choice."
OnePlus 7 Pro,Introduction,"With the OnePlus 7 Pro ($669), this cult smartphone maker continues its trajectory as a swiftly rising flagship killer. Not only is this the fastest Android phone we've ever tested, it's also loaded with a gorgeous, notchless screen, cool hardware, and smart software features that outpace even the Samsung Galaxy S10+. If you're looking for a big, powerful Android phone (especially if you're with T-Mobile), the OnePlus 7 Pro is an obvious pick, and our Editors' Choice."
OnePlus 7 Pro,Models and Pricing,"There are three different versions of the OnePlus 7 Pro: 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage for $669, 8/256 for $699, and 12/256 for $749 (the latter two sold by T-Mobile). The phone comes in blue or gray versions. There will be two other models of the OnePlus 7 series, but the 7 Pro is the only one we'll see here in the US. The regular OnePlus 7 is for more price-sensitive countries (the company is very popular in India) and the OnePlus 7 5G is for countries with 3.5GHz 5G networks (which we don't have here)."
OnePlus 7 Pro,Physical Form Factor and Screen,"At 6.4 by 3 by 0.34 inches (HWD) and 7.26 ounces, this is a big phone. It's not actually larger than, say, a Galaxy Note, but anyone who's read my reviews knows I'm an aficionado of smaller models because I can spend hours a day standing up holding a subway pole with one hand while trying to use my phone with the other. This phone feels large and a bit slippery to grip, but your mileage obviously may vary."
OnePlus 7 Pro,Physical Form Factor and Screen,"From the front, the phone almost looks like a Samsung with its curved OLED screen, until you realize there's no notch, just a lot of screen. The selfie camera pops up from a little cutout on the top of the phone, so even that doesn't take up space where screen could go. There's also a ribbed mute switch that has appeared on OnePlus phones for years. There's still no headphone jack or microSD slot, if those things matter to you (though OnePlus separately sells the excellent $19.99 Type-C Bullets)."
OnePlus 7 Pro,Physical Form Factor and Screen,"Our 7 Pro is a shimmery blue color. The phone's glass back is slightly slippery, with a smooth, cool feeling to it, and scratches easily. The phone comes with a clear case in the box, which you should apply as soon as you get it. The case also makes the body much grippier."
OnePlus 7 Pro,Physical Form Factor and Screen,"OnePlus keeps trying to ride a line where it makes its phones sort-of-waterproof, but it doesn't pay for IP certification. I dunked and washed the phone, rather than soaking it for an extended period of time. Some condensation appeared inside the pop-up selfie camera, and the microphone was messed up for about an hour, but after a few hours, the phone was perfectly fine."
OnePlus 7 Pro,Physical Form Factor and Screen,"The 6.67-inch, 3,120-by-1,440 resolution screen is a Samsung OLED panel tuned to OnePlus's specifications, and it's even comparable with the Galaxy's (and far better than, say, the Google Pixel 3's). I tested the screen's colors and brightness with a Klein K-80 colorimeter and Portrait Displays' CalMAN and MobileForge software. As you can see, the OnePlus 7's colors are just about the same as the Galaxy S10+'s (and they're more accurate than the OnePlus 6T's). At 411cd/m2 in ""vivid"" mode and 402cd/m2 in ""natural,"" it's close to the Galaxy S10's maximum brightness of 435cd/m2."
OnePlus 7 Pro,Physical Form Factor and Screen,"The chart below shows the OnePlus 7 Pro's color levels as dots and DCI-P3 color levels as boxes in both Natural and Vivid modes, alongside the color performance of the OnePlus 6T and Samsung Galaxy S10+. All phones have slightly cool whites, but the 7 Pro demonstrates particularly admirable, accurate performance in Vivid mode."
OnePlus 7 Pro,Physical Form Factor and Screen,"The big innovation here is the 90Hz refresh rate. In its standard UI, the OnePlus 7 displays 1.5 frames for every one frame most other phones do, resulting in what appears to be smoother scrolling. Whether you can perceive this depends on what you're used to. Our analyst Chris Stobing, a big PC gamer who uses high-refresh-rate gaming monitors, noticed it instantly; it took me a lot longer to see it. Over time, the high refresh rate should mean less eyestrain."
OnePlus 7 Pro,Physical Form Factor and Screen,"Higher refresh rate scrolling takes more battery power, but the OnePlus 7 deals with this intelligently by reducing the refresh rate if you're watching lower-frame-rate content, like 30fps videos. It actually isn't clear to me (and OnePlus couldn't help) if the 90Hz applies outside the general UI. Our GFXBenchmark graphics benchmark topped out at displaying 60 frames per second, which may be a limit in the Android APIs. I know Razer, which also sells a high-frame-rate phone, had to write special extensions to get games to run at higher frame rates."
OnePlus 7 Pro,Physical Form Factor and Screen,"I'd dare say the in-display fingerprint sensor is the best one on the market. While it's optical and not ultrasonic, it seems to have a slightly larger target area than Samsung's sensor does (it's 36 percent bigger than the one on the OnePlus 6T), and it is very fast to recognize my fingers. Your fingertip still has to be dry and clean; a wet finger reduces recognition to about 80 percent reliability, and putting food on my finger (like guacamole or peanut butter) renders the sensor useless and slightly gross."
OnePlus 7 Pro,Software and Benchmarks,"The OnePlus 7 runs Android 9 with OnePlus's Oxygen OS extensions on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 chipset, the same one that's in the Galaxy S10 line and the LG G8. That said, it benchmarked the best of any Android phone we've ever seen, because of OnePlus's focus on software speed. I got 9,828 on PCMark and 481.94 on the Basemark Web benchmark compared with 9,547 and 406.84 on the Galaxy S10."
OnePlus 7 Pro,Software and Benchmarks,"The use of UFS 3.0 internal storage here definitely helps. The OnePlus got 12,889 on the PCMark Storage benchmark, compared with 9,099 on the Galaxy S10 and 10,152 on the OnePlus 6T. That may also explain why the OnePlus got ever-so-slightly higher scores than the Galaxy phones on Geekbench."
OnePlus 7 Pro,Software and Benchmarks,"OnePlus says the phone has a special cooling system, which lets it run at top speed for extended periods of time. After 10 minutes using a processor-slamming app, the 7 Pro was running at 92% of top processing potential, as compared with the Galaxy S10e at 90 percent. I wouldn't consider that a noticeable difference."
OnePlus 7 Pro,Software and Benchmarks,"OnePlus' Oxygen OS remains, alongside Motorola's approach, the smartest and smoothest Android skin out there. It adds useful features like the ability to load two Facebook or Instagram accounts at the same time without becoming sluggish."
OnePlus 7 Pro,Software and Benchmarks,"One new innovation, Zen Mode, enhances Google's ""digital wellness"" features by essentially locking your phone for 20 minutes at a time. During that period, you can receive phone calls, make emergency calls, and use the camera, but that's it. You can't even turn it off during those 20 minutes. Is it wrong that I kind of like it?"
OnePlus 7 Pro,Software and Benchmarks,"OnePlus says that the phone will get updates for the next two versions of Android, and maybe beyond that. The OnePlus 3, a three-year-old phone, got an update to Android 9."
OnePlus 7 Pro,Wireless and Battery,"The OnePlus 7 Pro is compatible with T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&T, but is only sold by T-Mobile on the carrier end. It has all the frequency bands for Sprint, but hasn't been certified and so won't attach to that network. The T-Mobile-sold versions will work with that carrier's VoLTE and Wi-Fi calling systems, and with Verizon's VoLTE system (but not Wi-Fi calling). AT&T doesn't allow unlocked phones into its VoLTE or Wi-Fi calling systems. Also, while the unlocked 7 Pro has dual SIM card slots, the T-Mobile model doesn't."
OnePlus 7 Pro,Wireless and Battery,"As with previous OnePlus phones, it's one notch lower in terms of modem capabilities than its Snapdragon X24 modem allows: Category 18 with 5-carrier aggregation, rather than Category 20 with 7-carrier aggregation like the Galaxy S10. That said, I don't think that's going to make a big difference in the US, where attaching to more than five bands of spectrum at once is rare enough to be practically unheard of. The OnePlus 7 Pro has 4x4 MIMO on bands 2, 4, 7, and 66. That makes it ideal for T-Mobile, Verizon, and Canadian carriers, but less so for AT&T, where I would like to see 4x4 on Band 30."
OnePlus 7 Pro,Wireless and Battery,"I gave the OnePlus 7 Pro the full signal testing routine, with our usual help from Cellular Insights. Focusing on T-Mobile's primary frequency bands, I compared the phone with a bunch of other top phones on LTE Band 4 (used primarily in cities) and to the Samsung Galaxy S10 on LTE Band 12 (used more in suburban and rural areas)."
OnePlus 7 Pro,Wireless and Battery,"The 7 Pro did very well with a weak Band 4 signal, roundly beating the Galaxy S10 and generally staying on par with the LG V40, the phone we rated as having the best signal strength available last year. With a strong Band 4 signal, the 7 Pro generally got speeds higher than an iPhone XS Max and OnePlus 6T, although in some situations not quite up to the level of the LG V40. In both Band 4 situations, the OnePlus 7 Pro generally beat the Samsung Galaxy S10."
OnePlus 7 Pro,Wireless and Battery,"The S10 did a bit better on Band 12, however. There, the Samsung tracked consistently a notch faster than the OnePlus 7 Pro, including being able to pull out a tiny bit more of signal out at the end."
OnePlus 7 Pro,Wireless and Battery,"The real takeaway here is that the OnePlus 7 Pro handles LTE, at least on the T-Mobile network, like a world-beating flagship smartphone, and it'll give you a great 4G experience."
OnePlus 7 Pro,Wireless and Battery,"Rohde & Schwarz, the global leader in test and measurement equipment, provided Cellular Insights with the cutting-edge CMWFlexx solution consisting of two CMW500 Wideband Communication Tester boxes, CMWC Controller, and R&S TS7124 RF shielded box equipped with four Vivaldi antennas for up to 4_4 MIMO, ensuring high reproducibility of near-field OTA MIMO measurements. The study was done independently by Cellular Insights and shared with PCMag."
OnePlus 7 Pro,Wireless and Battery,"For other wireless standards, the OnePlus 7 Pro has Bluetooth 5.0 with AptX HD, dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11ac, and NFC. Once again, it's not bleeding edge; unlike the Galaxy S10, there's no attempt to build an early 802.11ax client here. But just like with the LTE situation, OnePlus decided that there aren't a lot of 802.11ax networks out there yet, so it wasn't worth the extra expense to push the boundaries."
OnePlus 7 Pro,"Call Quality, Battery, and Charging","With a device at this level, good call quality should be a given. It's fine on here; I have no complaints except when the microphone had water in it. The phone has dual stereo speakers, with the earpiece under the screen. Volume is good, with a maximum of 96dB on our test right up against the earpiece, and 86dB (3dB louder than the Galaxy S10) for the speakerphone at a 6-inch distance. The speaker sounds a little tinny; the Galaxy seems to have more depth."
OnePlus 7 Pro,"Call Quality, Battery, and Charging","With a large 4,000 mAh battery, the 7 Pro takes a long time to drain. I got 11 hours, 37 minutes in my rundown test. In ordinary use, the phone would comfortably last two days, definitely outpacing my smaller Galaxy S10e, which I've needed to charge late in the day when I've been using it."
OnePlus 7 Pro,"Call Quality, Battery, and Charging","OnePlus CEO Pete Lau has repeatedly belittled wireless charging, and true to form, this phone doesn't have it. What it does have is a gigantic 30W charger, which can power the phone very quickly. I went from zero to 35 percent in 15 minutes, 62 percent in 30 minutes, and 95 percent in an hour. That said, this is a proprietary charging system and so it won't refuel the phone at these speeds with, say, USB-C PD chargers or Qualcomm fast chargers."
OnePlus 7 Pro,Cameras,"OnePlus is a sibling company to Oppo and Vivo, major Chinese smartphone makers who don't sell products in the US, and it can borrow some of their innovative ideas that would never be seen in this country otherwise. The OnePlus 7 Pro features America's first pop-up selfie camera, originally introduced with the Vivo Nex S in China. The phone's 48-megapixel Sony camera sensor has also appeared on Oppo and Vivo phones in China, but it hasn't been seen here until the 7 Pro."
OnePlus 7 Pro,Cameras,"The front-facing, pop-up camera is a Sony 16MP IMX471 sensor with 1080p video recording. It's fine. The most interesting aspect of it, of course, is that it pops up: When you do something that demands a selfie, including waking up the phone with facial ID activated, the little motor whirs and the camera appears. When you switch away from your application, the camera retracts."
OnePlus 7 Pro,Cameras,"Obviously, the first question will be: Can you break it? The camera protects itself from drops by retracting when it senses the accelerometer. I tested by dropping it from waist-height several times, and it retracted before it hit the floor. On the other hand, if you bang the extended camera against a table, you will probably break it. That's the price to pay for having no notch."
OnePlus 7 Pro,Cameras,"On the back, there's the 48-megapixel Sony IMX586 sensor with an f/1.6 lens, an 8-megapixel sensor with a 3x telephoto lens, and a 16-megapixel sensor with a 117-degree wide-angle lens. The camera usually defaults to 12-megapixel images with 4-pixel binning for better low-light performance, but you can kick it into 48MP mode (or RAW) in the camera app's ""pro"" mode. The main camera also records 4K video at up to 60fps, and does slow-mo down to 480fps at 720p."
OnePlus 7 Pro,Cameras,"That's a lot of options, and it adds up to a camera that specializes in cropping and zooming."
OnePlus 7 Pro,Cameras,"Low-light performance here is specifically tuned to balance out images with a lot of dynamic range, as opposed to taking pictures in very low light. That means an outdoor image with a streetlight in it will have fewer halos, like this one of the grocery store below. But a photo taken in very low light, like the one of the bookshelf below, will be much noisier."
OnePlus 7 Pro,Cameras,"We saw similar issues in low light with the Huawei P30 Pro. Notice how the colors are more saturated and the mural of the girl is sharper in the Huawei photo, but the OnePlus image does well with the lower right hand corner of the frame where the light is blaring."
OnePlus 7 Pro,Cameras,Colors on the OnePlus camera also seem to be a bit less saturated than those on the the Galaxy S10's.
OnePlus 7 Pro,Cameras,"The camera software is clearly a moving target, though. During our review period, the camera received a software update which made photos taken in good light look sharper. Before the update, shots were noticeably fuzzy compared with either the S10 or Huawei; after it, they were about on par with the S10, albeit with less-saturated colors."
OnePlus 7 Pro,Cameras,"The combination of a 48MP main lens and a 8MP sensor with a 3x zoom lens offers an unusual set of options. The 48MP mode really messes with dynamic range, so it isn't for amateurs like myself. As you can see here, in ordinary daylight, the 48MP image (at right) tends to be both blown out and shadowy."
OnePlus 7 Pro,Cameras,"The 3x-zoom camera makes zoom shots dramatically sharper than they are without an optical zoom, of course, and much sharper than you would get by digitally zooming the 48MP image. Here's what the 3x zoom and 48MP modes look zoomed to 8x:"
OnePlus 7 Pro,Cameras,"As a bad photographer, I can say this: This camera is fun. The different lenses, various modes, and easy-to-use ""pro"" mode give you a lot to play with, and that can balance out the slightly less-than-ideal low-light performance."
OnePlus 7 Pro,Conclusions,"If you're in the market for a big, new phone, it's impossible to find better value than the OnePlus 7 Pro. The gorgeous screen, killer speed, and notchless design make for a powerful, luxurious smartphone experience. And you really won't be bothered by the minor differences in low-light camera quality, considering you have all those different lenses to play with."
OnePlus 7 Pro,Conclusions,"OnePlus cuts a few corners here, but does so strategically by making them features that aren't a big deal in the larger scheme of the phone's value, including bleeding-edge wireless standards and durable back paint. It instead pours attention into dramatic, visible features, like the notchless screen and all those rear cameras. To boot, the phone is priced $300 lower than the competing Galaxy S10+ and the iPhone XS Max."
OnePlus 7 Pro,Conclusions,"Along with other flagships, it's worth comparing this with the brand-new, $479 Google Pixel 3a XL. We haven't tested that phone yet, but from its specs, it seems like a lot less phone than the OnePlus 7 Pro. The Pixel 3a XL is slower, lacks zoom or wide-angle cameras, and has a lower-resolution screen, less RAM, and bigger bezels. The Pixel 3a XL will be enough phone for many people, to be sure, but it isn't in the OnePlus 7 Pro's league."
OnePlus 7 Pro,Conclusions,"OnePlus owners love their phones: The manufacturer won our Reader's Choice award this year for having the most passionate fans. It's clear why: OnePlus delivers the best performance per dollar of any Android phone around. Unless you (like me) need a smaller phone, the OnePlus 7 is the best phone to buy on T-Mobile right now and our Editors' Choice."
OnePlus 7 (for China),Introduction,"Over the past several years, OnePlus has slowly built a loyal following worldwide. While its competitive pricing has played a large role in the company's growth, it would be shortsighted to say its focus on aesthetics, quality hardware, and thoughtful software haven't played a big part in it becoming a household name. The company's latest phone, the OnePlus 7 Pro (3,999 yuan, approximately $576), pushes the envelope further with more refined hardware and software than ever, a pop-up selfie camera, and an improved AMOLED display. It offers flagship performance for much less than you'll pay for an Apple or Samsung phone, and earns our Editors' Choice for high-end handsets for China."
OnePlus 7 (for China),"Design, Display, and Audio","Before we get started, if you're looking for a review of the US model of the OnePlus 7 Pro, you can find that here. This is a review of the Chinese version."
OnePlus 7 (for China),"Design, Display, and Audio","For the most part, the OnePlus 7 Pro follows the traditional flagship aesthetic, in that it's essentially a glass sandwich around an aluminum frame. It measures 6.4 by 3.0 by 0.3 inches (HWD) and comes in at a hefty 7.3 ounces. It's available in black, blue, or gold. Our black test unit quickly became a fingerprint magnet, but you'll probably want to invest in a good case since it doesn't offer any formal drop protection or water resistance, though OnePlus says the phone is mildly resistant to splashes."
OnePlus 7 (for China),"Design, Display, and Audio","The front of the phone is dominated by a 6.67-inch curved AMOLED display with almost nonexistent bezels. Instead of adding a camera notch like so many other phones do these days, the OnePlus 7 Pro has a pop-up selfie camera. Display resolution comes in at 3,120 by 1,440, with 516 pixels per inch. It's absolutely gorgeous display for streaming multimedia, and features a 90Hz refresh rate for smoother gaming and scrolling speeds."
OnePlus 7 (for China),"Design, Display, and Audio","Of all the Chinese phones we've tested (and most US phones), the OnePlus 7 Pro's in-display fingerprint sensor is the most consistent and easy to use. It worked without issue nearly every time we used the phone over a period of several weeks."
OnePlus 7 (for China),"Design, Display, and Audio","When it comes to audio, the OnePlus 7 Pro is a bit of a letdown. For calls, the earpiece is loud enough to hold a conversation on a busy street, coming in at 88dB. But while the phone sports Dolby Atmos-powered stereo speakers that come in at 93dB, the sound is tinny at higher volumes. And for private listening, you need to use Bluetooth headphones as there's no 3.5mm headphone jack."
OnePlus 7 (for China),Cameras,"On the back of the OnePlus 7 Pro you'll find a triple camera stack, including a 48MP wide-angle lens with a f/1.6 aperture and optical image stabilization (OIS), an 8MP telephoto lens with 3x zoom and OIS with a narrow f/2.4 aperture, and a 16MP ultra-wide-angle lens with an f/2.2 aperture."
OnePlus 7 (for China),Cameras,"For the most part, the phone takes solid photos in bright light. In our camera tests we noticed reds and yellows are slightly undersaturated, and there's some minor background blurring. Low-light photos are pretty good as well, though background blurring is more significant and there's a tinge of noise on the edges of a few of our photos. And wide-angle photos have a tendency to look a bit soft. Overall, images are absolutely fine for the average shutterbug and sharing on social media, but if you're looking for the best smartphone camera on the market, you'll want to opt for the Huawei P30 Pro."
OnePlus 7 (for China),Cameras,"The 16MP front-facing pop-up camera has an f/2.0 aperture. Bright-light photos are good, with some minor foreground blurring. Low-light photos are also surprisingly solid, though background noise was present in several of our test shots. And if you're worried about the pop-up camera snapping off during an accidental drop, fear not: If a drop is detected, the camera quickly retracts back into the body of the phone."
OnePlus 7 (for China),Hardware and Benchmarks,"For the price, the OnePlus 7 Pro ships with some impressive hardware. It sports a top-of-the-line Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 processor along with 6GB of RAM standard, as well as 8GB and 12GB options. If you opt for the 6GB version there's 128GB of storage onboard, while the 8GB and 12GB versions come with 256GB of storage. None have a microSD slot."
OnePlus 7 (for China),Hardware and Benchmarks,Performance is excellent. Apps opened instantaneously and we had no problem multitasking between a dozen apps at the same time. We even managed to play Asphalt 8 for over an hour with no skipped frames or freezing.
OnePlus 7 (for China),Hardware and Benchmarks,"In our benchmark tests, the OnePlus 7 Pro blows away the competition. It scored 9,874 on PCMark, a benchmarking suite that emulates everyday smartphone tasks. On the Ludashi (LDS) benchmark it was equally impressive, scoring 359,913 and falling only behind the Vivo IQOO (387,303) and the ZTE Axon Pro 10 5G (412,288). CPU performance came in at 115,281, while GPU performance came in at 150,401. RAM clocked in at 42,768 and the storage score was a solid 51,463. Overall it's a strong performer that should easily keep chugging along for a few years."
OnePlus 7 (for China),Hardware and Benchmarks,"In addition to regular performance benchmarks, the OnePlus 7 Pro is well equipped to handle AI tasks. In AI Benchmark, a suite of tests that require the phone to identify different objects, people, and locations, it scored 25,258. That's slightly behind the ZTE Axon 10 Pro (27,274), though the OnePlus 7 Pro had a lower error rate overall."
OnePlus 7 (for China),Hardware and Benchmarks,"The phone is powered by a 4,000mAh battery. With the display set to 90MHz, the phone lasted 10 hours, 48 minutes in our rundown test, streaming video at full brightness over Wi-Fi. More conservative use should easily get you two days between charges. If you do find yourself running low on juice, a 30W Warp Charge adapter is included in the box that can add hours of battery life to the phone in minutes."
OnePlus 7 (for China),Software and Special Features,"Since phones sold in China aren't allowed to use Google Services or the Play store, each handset manufacturer creates its own highly modified take on Android with a custom app store and apps. In many cases this leads to messy software full of bloatware. Fortunately, that's not the case on the OnePlus 7 Pro; in fact, it's the most elegant UI we've seen on a Chinese phone."
OnePlus 7 (for China),Software and Special Features,"The OnePlus 7 Pro ships with Android 9.0 Pie, running the HydrogenOS extension. Apps are well organized on the home screen, and while it sports the traditional navigation bar by default, you can easily switch to OnePlus' elegant navigation gestures in the phone's settings."
OnePlus 7 (for China),Software and Special Features,"The interface is elegant and minimal, but it also allows lots of customizations. You can adjust the screen refresh rate, customize the display color, and even set up apps in Reading mode, which switches the screen to a grayscale that's easier on the eyes."
OnePlus 7 (for China),Software and Special Features,"We're also fond of the Alert Slider on the right side of the phone, which allows you to easily switch between ring, vibrate, and silent modes. It's a simple feature, but it's one that makes using the OnePlus 7 Pro a pleasure."
OnePlus 7 (for China),Conclusions,"The OnePlus 7 Pro offers a lot of bang for the buck. For a lot less than most flagships, you get the best mobile processor on the market, plenty of RAM, and 128GB (or more) of storage. It makes some compromises like a merely average camera and tinny speakers. But that doesn't change the fact that it's an excellent bargain, with the best software experience you'll find on a Chinese phone, and that earns it our Editors' Choice."
OnePlus 7 Pro 5G,Introduction,"At $840, the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G for Sprint is the least expensive 5G phone in the US. Samsung's models cost over $1,200; LG's V50 costs $999. Even Verizon's Moto Z4 plus 5G Moto Mod, which is heavier and nowhere near as powerful as the OnePlus, costs $850. In an era of $1,000 iPhones and Galaxies, I don't think an $840 flagship Android phone with a gorgeous 90Hz screen and three cameras is outrageous, with or without 5G. The OnePlus 7 Pro 5G would be the only 5G phone you should buy, if you should buy a 5G phone. But you shouldn't."
OnePlus 7 Pro 5G,What's Different?,"By and large, the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G for Sprint is the same phone as the OnePlus 7 Pro for T-Mobile, so take a look at our full review of that phone for more details. I've been using the T-Mobile OnePlus 7 Pro as my primary phone for the past few months (replacing a Samsung Galaxy S10e), and I'm been happy to say that performance and battery life have held up. I have a few small scratches on the screen and some noticeable dust in ports, but the pop-up selfie camera has had no problems."
OnePlus 7 Pro 5G,What's Different?,"OnePlus is probably the best manufacturer outside of Google when it comes to continually delivering software improvements. A beta of Android 10 is already available for the OnePlus 7 lineup, and the phone has gotten monthly software tweaks for stability, experience quality, and especially touching up the autofocus in its camera."
OnePlus 7 Pro 5G,What's Different?,"With its super-smooth 90Hz screen, the OnePlus 7 Pro is the butteriest, smoothest-running Android phone out there right now. The one thing you give up is that it isn't the ultimate in camera quality. While autofocus has definitely gotten better, images aren't quite as punchy as you get on a Samsung or Apple phone, with a tighter dynamic range and low-light performance that falls well behind the lastest phones from Apple and Google (although OnePlus' Nightscape mode helps somewhat, when you remember to use it)."
OnePlus 7 Pro 5G,What's Different?,The 5G model of the phone is 0.32 ounce heavier than the standard model—the weight of a 5G chipset. The model Sprint sells has 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.
OnePlus 7 Pro 5G,What's Different?,"In typical OnePlus fashion, there is delightfully little bloatware on this phone. Sprint only adds one app: Caller ID. In comparison, the Sprint version of the Galaxy S10+ 5G has eight Sprint apps, six Amazon apps, eight ""featured"" apps, and seven Samsung apps. OnePlus keeps things clean."
OnePlus 7 Pro 5G,The Great Sprint Mystery,"Sprint currently operates the most usable, meaningful 5G network in the US. While AT&T and Verizon struggle with thorny millimeter-wave technology and T-Mobile waits for phones that will support its low-band network, Sprint has extended broad coverage over nine major cities (Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Kansas City, LA, New York, Phoenix, and Washington) and 11 million people."
OnePlus 7 Pro 5G,The Great Sprint Mystery,"The applications that are going to require super-duper speeds from 5G are a few years down the road. Most people will be totally happy with getting 50Mbps all the time, and Sprint's limited speed but broad coverage form of 5G fits that bill. And over the next few years, there could be spectrum to be bought and deals to be made that can improve Sprint's speeds."
OnePlus 7 Pro 5G,The Great Sprint Mystery,"But Sprint hasn't announced plans to extend its network. The company's owner, Softbank, wants to immolate it into the body of T-Mobile, and all sorts of decisions seem to be on hold while this drama plays out in a series of boardrooms and courtrooms."
OnePlus 7 Pro 5G,The Great Sprint Mystery,"Making things worse, Sprin-T-Mobile won't explain in detail what its compatibility and expansion plans would be because of legal regulatory concerns. The companies give broad, vague promises and assertions, but not details."
OnePlus 7 Pro 5G,The Great Sprint Mystery,"I don't know if Sprint will maintain its independence and struggle on, if it will vanish (along with thousands of jobs in Kansas City) into a cloud of smoke, or whether it can even make a deal with T-Mobile to share spectrum and go on as two independent companies sharing some network facilities, the way Bell and Telus do in Canada. (In my mind, that third choice would be by far the best for consumers.) But the shuddering storm clouds here make it hard to recommend any Sprint 5G device, as good as it may be."
OnePlus 7 Pro 5G,The Great Sprint Mystery,"The reason this impacts your phone choice is that the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G—and all of Sprint's initial 5G phones—only support one of three different kinds of 5G that T-Mobile plans to run. If Sprint continues to stand alone, it will try to build out a network including most of the country's major cities that will be compatible with this phone. But if the merger happens, this phone will only be able to access a slice of what T-Mobile plans to set up, not the full thing. In that case, it would make much more sense to wait for phones that can access the whole ""new T-Mobile"" network."
OnePlus 7 Pro 5G,"The Best, Not the Fastest","I tested the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G around New York City against a Samsung Galaxy S10+ 5G. While the two phones showed about the same level of reception, I got consistently slower speeds on the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G both on the 4G and 5G networks."
OnePlus 7 Pro 5G,"The Best, Not the Fastest","I was very impressed with Sprint's coherent, consistent coverage where I was testing in midtown and lower Manhattan. More than on any other carrier, I had a consistent 5G signal while wandering around central districts. It wasn't totally perfect—it dropped to LTE from time to time—but it was easier to find than the three other carriers' networks have been, even T-Mobile's relatively dense network."
OnePlus 7 Pro 5G,"The Best, Not the Fastest","Sprint's form of 5G also doesn't make phones overheat. The millimeter-wave 5G being used by AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon, so far, caused phones to overheat when I was testing them this summer—a problem I've never seen with Sprint's mid-band 5G, which uses the same radio frequencies as 4G networks do. (For what it's worth, I've heard the overheating issue may be solved through the carriers pushing new network software; I'm just saying I haven't seen it solved in practice yet.)"
OnePlus 7 Pro 5G,"The Best, Not the Fastest","Top speeds were similar between the two phones: 350Mbps on the OnePlus phone and 369Mbps on the Samsung. But the OnePlus averaged 111Mbps down on 4G and 163Mbps down on 5G, while the Samsung averaged 142Mbps down on 4G and 188Mbps down on 5G in tests taken sequentially at the same locations."
OnePlus 7 Pro 5G,"The Best, Not the Fastest","Either phone will significantly improve your experience if you're in one of Sprint's 5G cities. I saw no 5G result slower than 29.7Mbps down, meaning when there was a 5 in the status bar, things feel much less frustrating than they often do in weaker Sprint 4G areas."
OnePlus 7 Pro 5G,"The Best, Not the Fastest","Digging into the 7 Pro 5G's capabilities, I think I figured out why I got faster overall speeds on the Samsung. Sprint's 5G system bonds 4G and 5G—it uses both at the same time. The LTE in the 4G version of the OnePlus 7 Pro is a notch slower than the LTE in the Galaxy S10+. While they have the same Qualcomm modem, the OnePlus has Category 18 LTE, while the S10+ has Category 20."
OnePlus 7 Pro 5G,"The Best, Not the Fastest","In most times and places, this doesn't matter. Looking at the massively crowdsourced data from Ookla Speedtest Intelligence, for instance, the OnePlus 7 Pro on T-Mobile and the Galaxy S10+ have just about the same LTE speed. (Note: Ookla is owned by Ziff Davis, PCMag.com's parent company.) But a slight difference in the ability to bond LTE channels on Sprint's network would explain the difference I saw in the results. For now, the difference between the two phones wouldn't lead me to not recommend the OnePlus—if Sprint could be relied upon."
OnePlus 7 Pro 5G,Conclusions,"The OnePlus 7 Pro is currently my favorite overall Android phone, and the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G is my favorite 5G phone. It's powerful, affordable, and doesn't overheat. Its network, in the nine cities where it's available, has superior coverage. It doesn't have the ultimate 5G performance, but it's good enough at a price that doesn't make me shudder. What's not to love?"
OnePlus 7 Pro 5G,Conclusions,"What's not to love, alas, is the Sprint/T-Mobile situation. Six months from now, Spree-Mobile could be asking us to go buy tri-band 5G phones and putting out ads about how it's prioritizing types of 5G this phone doesn't support. Sprint, T-Mobile, twelve states, the federal government, and whoever else is involved in this conflagration need to figure this out so we can all move forward. Until then, you should hold off on buying the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G or any other 5G device."
OnePlus 7T,Introduction,"For years, OnePlus had a simple strategy: Release one phone, its best, at any given time. Often that was two phones a year, but that was fine; each phone was its best at the moment. This year, the company has already released three versions of the OnePlus 7: the OnePlus 7, the 7 Pro, and the 7 Pro 5G. The $599 OnePlus 7T is not actually a sequel to the 7 Pro, although it replaces the 7 Pro on T-Mobile's shelves. It's the sequel to the 7. (There's also a 7T Pro, but it isn't coming to the US.) Yes, it's confusing. And this confusion trickles over into the phone itself, which feels like a step back from the OnePlus 7 Pro."
OnePlus 7T,A Flatter Screen,"The OnePlus 7T is roomy. It measures 6.33 by 2.93 by 0.32 inches (HWD) and weighs 6.70 ounces. The screen is flat, not curved; the extra edges make the difference between the 7T's 6.55 inches and the 7 Pro's 6.67 inches on the same-size body. There's a notch at the top of the screen for the front-facing camera that doesn't bother."
OnePlus 7T,A Flatter Screen,I like a flat screen better than a curved one. Curved screens have accidental touch problems and are harder to protect; my OnePlus 7 has a cracked screen corner even though it was in a case when I dropped it.
OnePlus 7T,A Flatter Screen,"The phone's solid metal body has all the usual OnePlus touches, most notably a physical mute slider, a USB-C port, and no headphone jack. The phone doesn't come with headphones or an adapter dongle. It also doesn't have a water-resistance rating, though OnePlus claims it's splash-proof."
OnePlus 7T,A Flatter Screen,"The 7T's 90Hz, 1080p AMOLED display is, in my mind, the best of most worlds. It's super bright, relatively power-efficient thanks to its lower pixel density, and has the butter-smooth 90Hz scrolling that I love on the OnePlus 7 Pro. Because of the higher refresh rate, it's significantly better than the iPhone XR's display. The 1080p resolution only becomes noticeable when you're trying to read small text, which looks better on a higher-resolution phone like the 7 Pro."
OnePlus 7T,A Flatter Screen,"Its default calibration is oddly blue, which I don't love. This carries through in both the Vivid and Natural display modes. Compared with the 7 Pro, the 7T is distinctly colder. You can tweak and fix this by going into an advanced display setting, which is a little irritating."
OnePlus 7T,Processor and Performance,"The 7T runs Android 10 with OnePlus' Oxygen OS extensions. Outside Google, OnePlus does the best Android builds in the business. They're fast and smooth, they have frequent updates, and they have subtle, useful touches. In the most recent Oxygen OS, I'd like to call out Zen Mode, which forces you to not use your phone for a while, and Night Mode, which dims and yellows the screen in the evenings. There's very little bloatware on this phone; OnePlus, wisely, relies on Google's apps and Google Assistant rather than trying to reinvent and duplicate everything like Samsung does."
OnePlus 7T,Processor and Performance,"The phone's basic performance is impeccable. The 7T is the only mainstream US phone I know of with a Snapdragon 855+ processor, which clocks the 855's ""performance"" core from 2.8GHz up to 2.96GHz. That does, in fact, juice processor-dependent tasks a bit. The 7T scored 2752 on the Geekbench 5 multicore score to the 7 Pro's 2668."
OnePlus 7T,Processor and Performance,"But that's made up for by what appears to be slower storage. On the PCMark Storage test, the 7T scored only 7995 compared with the 7 Pro's 12666. I was shocked enough by this to follow up with a test using the A1 SD Bench storage benchmark, and the 7T write speed was 238.9Mbps to the 7 Pro's 423.7Mbps."
OnePlus 7T,Processor and Performance,"Dropping the screen resolution to 1080p has the biggest positive effect on performance. It means on-screen frame rates in the GFXBench Car Chase test go from 21 to 41, and results in the Basemark Web browsing test bump up from 432 to 475. UI performance feels smoother, in general, because the phone is pushing fewer pixels."
OnePlus 7T,Processor and Performance,"The devicehas 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage compared with the 7 Pro's 12GB and 256GB. The RAM difference doesn't make much difference in practice, but the storage difference might hurt. That said, the $599 model of the iPhone XR only has 64GB."
OnePlus 7T,Wireless Capabilities,"The OnePlus 7T has Cat 18 LTE on lots of bands—every band used in the US, including the newest bands 46 (LAA) and 48 (CBRS). This makes for excellent overall coverage and performance. According to Ookla Speedtest Intelligence, the OnePlus 7 Pro holds its own with the Samsung Galaxy S10e on LTE performance and absolutely wipes the floor with the iPhone XR. (Note: Ookla is owned by Ziff Davis, PCMag.com's parent company.) The big difference between the 7T and inexpensive iPhones is in the 7T's 4x4 MIMO capability, which can double LTE speeds in good-signal conditions and help eke out better performance in low-signal conditions."
OnePlus 7T,Wireless Capabilities,"The phone also has Bluetooth 5.0, NFC, and Wi-Fi 5 (not 6, like in recent Apple and Samsung phones). There's a big debate over whether Wi-Fi 6 even matters in a phone right now; when I tested the latest Apple phones with a Wi-Fi 6 router, it didn't make much of a difference because of all the non-Wi-Fi-6 devices attached to the router."
OnePlus 7T,Wireless Capabilities,"Call quality is fine. The earpiece is a little picky—you get the best volume by holding the very top edge of the phone up to your ear. But the speakerphone is rich and clear. The phone supports HD calling with EVS for the best call quality, and VOLTE showed up when I tested it on AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon."
OnePlus 7T,Charging and Battery Life,"The 7T has Warp Charge 30T, which uses a 30-watt charger like the 7 Pro does, but supposedly lets it maintain maximum voltage for longer. It took a software update and several charging cycles to achieve its maximum potential, but when it did, it was impressive: 47 percent charged in 20 minutes, 71 percent in 30 minutes, 89 percent in 40 minutes, and a full charge in slightly under an hour. That matches up with OnePlus' promises. The 7 Pro charges to 62 percent in half an hour as compared with the 7T's 71 percent."
OnePlus 7T,Charging and Battery Life,"Battery life on the 3,800mAh cell came out at 8 hours, 59 minutes on our video rundown test, a little shorter than I like to see, and noticeably shorter than the OnePlus 7 Pro's 11 hours, 37 minutes."
OnePlus 7T,Charging and Battery Life,"OnePlus' CEO Pete Lau has come out several times saying he doesn't think wireless charging is a valuable feature, and none of the company's phones have it."
OnePlus 7T,"Three Cameras, None Great","The OnePlus 7T has three cameras on the back: a 12MP f/1.6 main one, a 12MP f/2.2 ""2x telephoto,"" and a 16MP f/2.2 117-degree wide-angle. The front camera is also 16MP."
OnePlus 7T,"Three Cameras, None Great","Despite the abundance of sensors, image quality isn't great. I'll call out two key areas: the 2x zoom lens and night shots. Combine the two and you have real issues. The 2x lens is softer than competitors like the iPhone 11 and even the OnePlus 7 Pro, and OnePlus' Nightscape mode over-brightens low-light images and makes them blurry."
OnePlus 7T,"Three Cameras, None Great","In normal light, with the standard lens, everything looks fine. If that's mostly how you roll, your experience will be very pleasant."
OnePlus 7T,"Three Cameras, None Great","But in low light, and especially with the zoom, things get really rough. I tested this multiple times, in multiple places, over multiple firmware versions, and kept getting the same results."
OnePlus 7T,"Three Cameras, None Great","The 7T also has more aggressive JPEG compression than either the 7 Pro or the iPhone 11, which is noticeable when you zoom all the way in."
OnePlus 7T,"Three Cameras, None Great",I think low-light photography is the real differentiator in the world of smartphone cameras right now. Google's Pixel line and the iPhone 11 series have really been pushing it forward. Samsung is pretty good. The OnePlus 7T is a significant step back from all of those.
OnePlus 7T,Conclusions,"I find the OnePlus 7T very confusing, but I'd feel less confused if the OnePlus 7 Pro didn't exist. Taken purely on its own, as a $599 alternative to the iPhone XR or Galaxy S10e, it has a lot going for it—a terrifically responsive screen with a smooth UI, fast charging, and excellent wireless performance."
OnePlus 7T,Conclusions,"But the phone's camera falls distinctly behind the night-vision capabilities of the $699 iPhone 11 or the $799 Google Pixel 4, and it's just a little too expensive to fit into the ""affordable"" price band with the $399 Google Pixel 3a."
OnePlus 7T,Conclusions,"If you're looking for a high-quality, big-screen Android phone at this price, the 7T is a perfectly good choice. But OnePlus needs to decide what the phone is: an affordable premium model, or a flagship killer. Things in between don't tend to fare well among US phone buyers, and the 7T, I'm afraid to say, is in that middle ground."
OnePlus 7T McLaren,Introduction,"The OnePlus 7T Pro McLaren is a good buy for a big phone on the ""New T-Mobile."" At $899.99, it costs $300 less than our Editor's Choice, the Samsung Galaxy S20+, and has slightly better network performance. With the McLaren's terrific screen, superior software, and good-enough camera, it's a tough decision whether the S20+ is worth the extra coin."
OnePlus 7T McLaren,Introduction,"A lot has happened since we first reviewed this phone in December, so we decided it's worth another look. Most notably, the Sprint/T-Mobile merger is effectively a done deal, and the Samsung Galaxy S20 lineup set a new standard for both high cost and performance. Whether you choose a McLaren or an S20+ on T-Mobile is going to come down to whether you need key additional specs on the S20+'s sheet. Do you live in a central city likely to get high-band 5G, do you want to experiment with 8K recording, or do you just want to be part of the Samsung mainstream? Then go with the S20+. Otherwise, the McLaren is a very compelling alternative."
OnePlus 7T McLaren,What's in a Name?,"OnePlus has a slightly confusing phone lineup right now. The McLaren is almost exactly like the OnePlus 7 Pro. It is less like the OnePlus 7T, which is a slightly lower-end phone with a somewhat different body and a different camera. That's to the McLaren's advantage; I find the OnePlus 7 Pro's camera performance to be better than the OnePlus 7T's. That said, there are some key differences with the McLaren, which I'll get into in this review."
OnePlus 7T McLaren,What's in a Name?,"And can we address that name? The phone is made by OnePlus, it uses the 7T processor and charger, it's in the Pro body, it has 5G, and it has something to do with a car company. It's an unfortunate mouthful, and should have been collapsed in some way. From here on out, we'll mostly just call it the McLaren."
OnePlus 7T McLaren,"The Same, Only Faster","The OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren is co-licensed with the McLaren car company, which is famous for its fast vehicles. Design-wise, that translates into a phone with a black body with orange accents and a wavy silver pattern on the back, along with a special orange cable and charger. It comes with a nice case with an Alcantara-esque black back that doesn't protect the front of the phone at all; I found that out when I dropped a 7 Pro in a similar case and cracked the corner of the screen."
OnePlus 7T McLaren,"The Same, Only Faster","The McLaren is the same size (6.4 by 3.0 by 0.35 inches), weight (7.27 ounces), and shape as the OnePlus 7 Pro. It is a very large phone, but you're getting power for the size. The 19.5:9, 3,120-by-1440, 6.67-inch, 90Hz AMOLED screen is an absolute wonder. Like the one on the 7 Pro, it's ultra-bright, with HDR10+ color support and a high refresh rate that makes scrolling particularly easy on the eyes."
OnePlus 7T McLaren,"The Same, Only Faster","This is among the fastest Android phones on the market, thanks to its clocked-up 2.96GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ processor and OnePlus' software build. It scored 10,899 on the PCMark Work 2.0 benchmark, as compared with the OnePlus 7T's 10,361 and the OnePlus 7's 10,043. I take that benchmark very seriously because it simulates actual tasks like web browsing and photo editing."
OnePlus 7T McLaren,"The Same, Only Faster","Otherwise, though, it benchmarks almost exactly the 7T, which also has the 855+ processor, putting the phones slightly ahead of ordinary 855-based devices. The 855+ pushes frame rates on the GFXBench Car Chase Offscreen graphics benchmark from 41-43 to 48, for instance, and bumps Geekbench single-core processor scores from around 745 to around 775. Those scores are all a bit behind the newer Snapdragon 865 processor in the Galaxy S20 series, however. We have a full benchmark story comparing the two series of phones."
OnePlus 7T McLaren,"The Same, Only Faster","That speedy processor combines with 256GB of UFS 3.0 storage and 12GB of RAM for a very smooth experience. The ridiculous, excessive amount of RAM means that pretty much all of the apps you've used recently will maintain their state if you flip back to them."
OnePlus 7T McLaren,"The Same, Only Faster","The real MVP here, though, is OnePlus's Oxygen OS version of Android 10, which is somehow even smoother and more efficient than the Google Pixel 4's. While it doesn't have some of the Pixel's latest buzzy features, such as live transcription, you'll have absolutely no problem with performance."
OnePlus 7T McLaren,"The Same, Only Faster","The McLaren has the same cameras as the 7 Pro does, but photo quality has improved with several months' worth of software updates. To recap, there's a main 48MP f/1.6 camera, a 16MP f/2.2 wide-angle camera, and an 8MP f/2.4 3x-zoom camera, along with a 16MP pop-up front-facing camera."
OnePlus 7T McLaren,"The Same, Only Faster","I took some shots at the Qualcomm Snapdragon Tech Summit in Maui and I was more impressed with the quality this time around than I was back when the 7 Pro launched. Low-light performance, especially, is less noisy than the Pixel 4's, although more prone to blur because of lower shutter speeds. You get hyper-saturated, punched-up colors, which is a big change from the original 7 Pro at launch."
OnePlus 7T McLaren,"The Same, Only Faster","The McLaren trades in the 7 Pro's Warp Charge 30 system for Warp Charge 30T, which charges the battery slightly faster. On the McLaren, we got a 37-percent charge in 15 minutes, compared with 35 percent on the 7 Pro in the same amount of time. The MacLaren charged to 70 percent in 30 minutes compared with 62 percent on the 7 Pro, and 99 percent in an hour versus the 7 Pro's 95 percent."
OnePlus 7T McLaren,"The Same, Only Faster","To get those speeds, you need to use the included charger and cable. The proprietary charging system doesn't work with standard USB-C PD chargers, and it doesn't support wireless charging."
OnePlus 7T McLaren,"The Same, Only Faster","In testing, battery life for the McLaren was slightly shorter than the 7 Pro, lasting 10 hours and 54 minutes in our streaming video rundown compared with the 7 Pro's 11 hours and 37 minutes. In a week of using the phone, I didn't have the sort of midday battery pressure I've experienced with the smaller Pixel 4 and Samsung Galaxy S10e."
OnePlus 7T McLaren,Leading the Way on Low-Band 5G,"The flagship feature here, really, is the 5G. At $899.99, the McLaren is more expensive than the $799.99 LG V60 ThinQ 5G, but less expensive than any of the Galaxy S20 series. The phone supports low-band and mid-band 5G, but not the high-band 5G that T-Mobile has in seven cities but seems uncomfortable talking about expanding."
OnePlus 7T McLaren,Leading the Way on Low-Band 5G,"That makes the McLaren similar to the V60 and Samsung's small S20. There's a confusing menu of different 5G options available right now. I've chosen the Galaxy S20+ as our Editors' Choice because it has everything, and you don't have to choose or think about low/middle/high bands. But that ends up costing a premium."
OnePlus 7T McLaren,Leading the Way on Low-Band 5G,"Low-band 5G is the least impressive form of 5G, with only slight improvements over 4G, but it's the ""nationwide"" one that most T-Mobile users will experience. Tested side by side with a Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra, the McLaren had superior low-band 5G performance, with an average of 120Mbps down and 41Mbps up compared with the Galaxy S20's 109Mbps down and 38Mbps up."
OnePlus 7T McLaren,Leading the Way on Low-Band 5G,"New York has very limited T-Mobile 5G capacity right now, though. The differences will probably be more striking in areas with better T-Mobile 5G, because the McLaren has a software update that Samsung phones haven't yet received to help combine low-band 4G and 5G channels for better performance. The latest I've heard is that the Samsung phones will receive that update in April."
OnePlus 7T McLaren,Leading the Way on Low-Band 5G,"I go into great detail in my in-depth analysis of T-Mobile's 5G, but that analysis is already a little stale. Once the T-Mobile/Sprint merger goes through, T-Mobile will start to reconfigure Sprint's 2.5GHz airwaves for 5G and will move more low-band 600MHz airwaves to 5G, greatly improving performance on phones like this one that support both of those frequencies."
OnePlus 7T McLaren,Leading the Way on Low-Band 5G,"This is going to open up some real performance differences over the next year or two with 4G-only phones like the OnePlus 7 Pro. The 7 Pro is very compelling at $549 to be sure, but you should be aware that after this half of the year, most of T-Mobile's network performance improvements will be on the 5G side."
OnePlus 7T McLaren,Comparisons and Conclusions,"The $899.99 McLaren gets you most of what the Galaxy S20+ offers, for $300 less (and $100 less than the smaller Galaxy S20). The screen has a slightly lower refresh rate, the processor is slightly slower, you can't record 8K video, and you don't get high-band 5G (which isn't on the smaller S20). But performance on the MacLaren feels terrific anyway, because OnePlus' software is just so darned good. Unlike Samsung's notorious skins, a OnePlus phone never feels weighed down or overly complex—it's a smooth, streamlined Android experience. Considering the substantial savings, that might just make it worth it for you."
OnePlus 8,Introduction,"OnePlus returns to its ""flagship killer"" roots with the OnePlus 8, the most affordable high-quality 5G phone T-Mobile and Verizon have to offer. Starting at $699, the 8's price is right and its feature set hits the sweet spot for providing a quality experience. For these reason we're awarding this relatively affordable flagship our Editor's Choice on the two carriers that sell it, although not on AT&T, where it lacks 5G support."
OnePlus 8,Let's Start With Some Math,"OnePlus is releasing two phones right now. The OnePlus 8 is available unlocked, and also via T-Mobile and Verizon. The OnePlus 8 Pro is only available unlocked. The OnePlus 8, which I'm reviewing here, sticks with the company's old philosophy of cutting a few corners (mostly in terms of camera) to shave several hundred dollars off of flagship phone prices, and it succeeds."
OnePlus 8,Let's Start With Some Math,The 8 Pro takes on the Samsung Galaxy S20 line with exclusive features like high-speed wireless charging and the absolute best display performance in the industry right now.
OnePlus 8,Let's Start With Some Math,"The factory-unlocked OnePlus 8 starts at $699, and I expect the T-Mobile model will cost the same. The Verizon model, which adds Verizon's millimeter-wave 5G, costs $799. That's what flagship-quality phones should cost, and it compares favorably with the similarly priced iPhone 11. The OnePlus 8 Pro, with its fancier screen, better camera, and wireless charging, starts at $899."
OnePlus 8,Let's Start With Some Math,"Galaxy S20+ prices are pretty confusing. The phone lists at $1,199.99, but it's $999.99 on Amazon right now, and can cost as little as $699.99 if you have a trade-in. Compared with an $1,199.99 Galaxy S20+, the OnePlus 8 provides a ton of value for far less money. Make the Galaxy S20+ $799 somehow, with a trade-in or other deal, and the Samsung phone is a better buy largely because of its superior camera. I'm basing my conclusions here on list pricing, but keep that in mind. "
OnePlus 8,Design and Display,"The OnePlus 8 comes in black, green, or in a shimmery mirror finish that looks absolutely breathtaking, but is also a terrible fingerprint magnet. I quickly wrapped my mirrored model in a textured black nylon case; OnePlus has always been good about making some cases and accessories available at launch."
OnePlus 8,Design and Display,"At 6.30 by 2.86 by 0.30 inches (HWD) and 6.34 ounces, the OnePlus 8 is on the smaller side for today's huge handsets, but it's still a big phone. It's not as narrow and one-hand-friendly as the Samsung Galaxy S10 or S20, much less the iPhone 8, but it's more manageable than anything that has a Plus in the name. The phone has the traditional OnePlus mute slider, and I'm sorry to say neither a 3.5mm headphone jack nor a microSD card slot. It doesn't come with headphones, either, but OnePlus will sell you a good pair of USB-C earbuds (its USB-C Bullets) for $24.95."
OnePlus 8,Design and Display,"The 16-megapixel front-facing camera is a notch design rather than the OnePlus 7 Pro's pop-up, but I don't think that's a big deal. It's pretty small, and unobtrusively in the corner."
OnePlus 8,Design and Display,"The OnePlus 8's screen is quite bright for an Android phone, beating the Galaxy S10 and OnePlus 7 on brightness and color accuracy. It's more color-accurate than the Galaxy S20 Ultra, but not as bright."
OnePlus 8,Design and Display,"Like the OnePlus 7, it's a 90Hz, 1080p screen; you can bump it down to 60Hz, but there's really no reason to. I didn't find that to have much impact on battery life, as the phone automatically downscales the refresh rate to 60Hz when it isn't doing 90Hz activities like gaming or scrolling. 1080p resolution is fine at this size and form factor. We have a more in-depth look at the screen technology and how it compares with rivals including the iPhone and Galaxy lineups, thanks to DisplayMate Labs."
OnePlus 8,Performance Up to Par,"The OnePlus 8 uses the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 processor as the Galaxy S20 line, and it benchmarked just about the same on Geekbench and GFXBench. That puts it at about 20 to 25 percent faster than last year's devices. I didn't see the advantage in PCMark, which tries to simulate actual workloads; with a score of 10,593, it looked more like last year's OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren. But I wouldn't read too much into that score—the OnePlus 8 did better than last year's phones on everything but PCMark's browsing test, which may use now-obsolete APIs."
OnePlus 8,Performance Up to Par,"There's no removable storage in the OnePlus 8, but the storage you do get is very fast. The phone scored 23,172 on PCMark's storage test, as compared with 18,000 or so for the Galaxy S20 line and 12,666 for the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G. That makes common activities like photo saves or app loads feel a lot snappier."
OnePlus 8,Performance Up to Par,"The default model of the OnePlus 8 has 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage; you can boost it to 12GB and 256GB for an extra $100. This device uses LPDDR4 RAM, which is a bit slower than the LPDDR5 used by the OnePlus 8 Pro and the Galaxy S20+."
OnePlus 8,Performance Up to Par,"OnePlus' version of Android 10, which it calls Oxygen OS, continues to be the fastest, smoothest Android skin other than Google's own. OnePlus keeps the bloatware to an absolute minimum, while offering lots of ways to tweak your system."
OnePlus 8,Performance Up to Par,"You can change fonts or icon packs, change the screen color temperature or vividness, mess with the control buttons and alert slider, install multiple copies of social networking apps or put some apps into an encrypted folder, for instance. All of this generally hides in the settings menu, so advanced settings don't get pushed on you, but they're there if you want them. I anticipate that the T-Mobile and Verizon versions of the phone will have bloatware, of course."
OnePlus 8,Performance Up to Par,"For unlocking, you have an in-display fingerprint sensor or Google's standard other options, including face unlock. I found the in-display fingerprint sensor, just like other in-display sensors, not as good as a physical sensor, but not worse than, say, the S20's in-display sensor."
OnePlus 8,Performance Up to Par,"The OnePlus 8's 4,300mAh battery powered the phone for 11 hours, 18 minutes of YouTube playback over Wi-Fi on its 90Hz setting. That's about an hour longer than I got with the OnePlus 8 Pro, probably because I was running the 8 Pro in its higher-resolution 2K screen mode. The phone supports OnePlus' proprietary Warp Charge 30T 30-watt charging, which charged it to 22 percent in 10 minutes and to 100 percent in an hour. Unlike the 8 Pro, the OnePlus 8 doesn't support wireless charging."
OnePlus 8,"5G, With Some Frills","The OnePlus 8 series has excellent network performance. There are four international models of the OnePlus 8, with four different sets of 5G frequency bands: US, EU, India, and China. The European model will work in India, but otherwise they aren't transferable across 5G networks. None of them are properly banded for upcoming Canadian networks. They all work on global 4G networks."
OnePlus 8,"5G, With Some Frills","The unlocked, $699 OnePlus 8 will only work on T-Mobile's mid- and low-band 5G networks. On Verizon and AT&T, it will be 4G. Verizon will sell a special model for $799 with all of its 5G network bands, including millimeter-wave. It's not clear to me whether the Verizon model will work on T-Mobile's millimeter-wave areas, but I assume not for now."
OnePlus 8,"5G, With Some Frills","The OnePlus 8 has 5G bands n2/n5/n41/n66/n71 with plenty of frills: 4x4 MIMO on n2/n41/n66, DSS, and the ability to do standalone 5G on bands 41 and 71. That's a lot of numbers. What it means is that the phone can do T-Mobile's low- and mid-band 5G at excellent speed, with the ability to shift up to the next level of low-latency network when New T-Mobile launches it later this year. The phone doesn't have millimeter-wave on T-Mobile, which the carrier currently has in seven cities. The presence of mmWave is one reason I recommended the Galaxy S20+ over the smaller Galaxy S20. But is it worth a $500 difference in list price to make a bet T-Mobile will expand that network to where you live soon? With the economy crashing, I have to bite my lip and say no."
OnePlus 8,"5G, With Some Frills","The Verizon model adds the carrier's millimeter-wave bands, including DSS on the mid and low bands, to use every 5G technology Verizon has planned for the next year. I have the unlocked model, so I couldn't test 5G on Verizon."
OnePlus 8,"5G, With Some Frills","It also has all of the 4G bands used in the US, including the more obscure bands 46 (LAA) and 48 (CBRS), which are used to improve speeds in crowded urban areas."
OnePlus 8,"5G, With Some Frills","I tested the OnePlus 8 against the Galaxy S20+ on T-Mobile. The 8's 5G performance was superior, probably because my Galaxy S20+ hasn't yet received a software update planned for April to let it more efficiently combine 4G and 5G. I also tested the 8 against the 8 Pro and the Galaxy S20 on AT&T's 4G network. They performed about the same, as I'd expect."
OnePlus 8,"5G, With Some Frills","I was pleased to see the unlocked OnePlus 8 has voice-over-LTE calling on AT&T, which isn't always a given with unlocked phones. Unfortunately, Wi-Fi calling isn't available on AT&T, although it is on T-Mobile and Verizon. On regular LTE networks, voice quality shines with the EVS (enhanced voice services) codec."
OnePlus 8,"5G, With Some Frills","The carrier models of the OnePlus 8 have only single SIMs. The unlocked model, as well as the unlocked OnePlus 8 Pro, has dual SIM slots."
OnePlus 8,Keeping Up With Camera Trends,"The OnePlus 8 has a 48-megapixel main camera, a 16-megapixel wide-angle camera, and a 2-megapixel macro camera. The main camera uses a Sony IMX586 sensor, the same one as in the OnePlus 7 Pro. While there is no dedicated zoom camera, the OnePlus 8 simulates 2x zoom by capturing a 48-megapixel image and cropping 12 megapixels out of the middle. There is also a 16-megapixel front-facing camera."
OnePlus 8,Keeping Up With Camera Trends,"Good camera performance in bright light is essentially a given for the premium smartphones nowadays, unless you run into disaster areas like the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra's focus problems. Where high-end cameras compete now is in features like zoom and low-light performance, and you can see a bit of difference there between the 8, the 8 Pro, and the Galaxy S20 line."
OnePlus 8,Keeping Up With Camera Trends,"The lack of a real zoom lens isn't as bad an issue as you'd think, because the 48-megapixel sensor adequately pretends to be a 2x zoom. Go to higher levels than that and you have obvious digital sharpening."
OnePlus 8,Keeping Up With Camera Trends,"Kicking the OnePlus 8 into 48-megapixel mode, the option to zoom in or out goes away. That's unlike on the Galaxy S20, which can push up to 6x digital zoom in its 64-megapixel mode. Comparing the 8 with the 8 Pro here, there's definitely more light coming into the 8 Pro, resulting in brighter, sharper images in this mode. Details are soft in several of my OnePlus 8 48-megapixel images, a problem I don't have with the OnePlus 8 Pro. The Galaxy S20's 64-megapixel mode is the sharpest of the bunch."
OnePlus 8,Keeping Up With Camera Trends,"The OnePlus 8's two-megapixel macro camera feels like a waste. The phone's main camera can focus perfectly fine at a distance of a few inches, and it delivers brighter images with better depth of field and clearer details than the macro camera does. I genuinely don't get why that lens is on there as opposed to something like a zoom lens that would provide actual user benefit."
OnePlus 8,Keeping Up With Camera Trends,"The low-light difference is all in the pixel-binning and software. Take the OnePlus 8 Pro, the OnePlus 8, and the Galaxy S20 all down to their 48- or 64-megapixel modes, and the images are pretty similar. But in 12-megapixel mode, especially in the software-powered night modes, the results are very different. There's a slight difference between the OnePlus 8 and the 8 Pro, with the 8 Pro's low-light images being a little sharper. The Galaxy S20's night mode is much more aggressive, resulting in much brighter images in very low light."
OnePlus 8,Keeping Up With Camera Trends,"Video recording is 4K, not 8K, up to 60fps 4K or 240fps 1080p slow-mo. That's significantly below what the Galaxy S20 offers, which is 8K video and 960fps slow-mo. But we're a few years away from people widely wanting to use 8K video—that resolution takes 500MB/minute, so it's mostly for people who later use editing software to pan and zoom around their videos. 4K is enough for mainstream users right now, and OnePlus delivers a nice, stabilized experience there."
OnePlus 8,What a 5G Phone Should Cost,"The OnePlus 8 Pro and the Galaxy S20+ both have advantages over the OnePlus 8, but they aren't that big, you will pay for them, and the economy is crashing to an extent none of us have seen in our lifetimes. The 8 Pro has slightly better camera performance, a nicer screen, and wireless charging; the S20 line has even better low-light camera performance and millimeter-wave 5G on T-Mobile. With the economy cratering, I want to give a 5G suggestion that doesn't break the bank. That's the OnePlus 8."
OnePlus 8,What a 5G Phone Should Cost,"The OnePlus 8 delivers a lot of experiences that are pretty similar to the OnePlus 7 Pro, my 2019 phone of the year, but in a slightly smaller form factor and with the addition of 5G. It costs $700 to $800, which is what a flagship smartphone should cost, not more. It's less expensive than alternatives from LG and Samsung, and it has key features, like 5G, that Apple's iPhone 11 lacks."
OnePlus 8,What a 5G Phone Should Cost,"At this moment, that feels right to me, so the OnePlus 8 earns our Editors' Choice for reasonably affordable 5G phones. Whether it feels right to you depends on your economic circumstances. If you can afford to spend more, the OnePlus 8 Pro is a good alternative for T-Mobile, while the Galaxy S20+ is a solid choice for any network."
OnePlus 8 Pro,Introduction,"If a phone's screen is its window to the world, the OnePlus 8 Pro shows you the world more beautifully than any other device. The $899 flagship has a brighter, more color-accurate, and more responsive display than any other phone on the market, even the $1,200 Samsung Galaxy S20+. But in the US, the OnePlus 8 Pro has a weird limitation—it's only 5G on T-Mobile's network, and even then, it lacks high-speed millimeter-wave 5G. Any $900 phone this year should really have some form of 5G in it, so we're awarding our Editors' Choice to the more affordable, more widely 5G-compatible OnePlus 8."
OnePlus 8 Pro,Design and Display,"Before we get into details, here's a quick rundown of how the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro compare with the Samsung Galaxy S20 and Galaxy S20+ on some key differentiators. Note that we don't recommend the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra—not only is it $1,500, its camera doesn't work that well even after being patched."
OnePlus 8 Pro,Design and Display,"The OnePlus 8 Pro follows the recent trend toward relatively large phones, at 6.50 by 2.92 by 0.33 inches (HWD) and 7 ounces. It's noticeably larger than the OnePlus 8, and even slightly larger than the Samsung Galaxy S20+. It comes in black, blue, or green, each with a matte finish that does a much better job resisting fingerprints than the OnePlus 8's silver model. The phone has the traditional OnePlus mute slider, but no 3.5mm headphone jack, nor does it come with USB-C headphones. OnePlus sells a good pair, the USB-C Bullets, for $24.95."
OnePlus 8 Pro,Design and Display,"The OnePlus 8 Pro's screen is, simply, the best in the business. A 120Hz, 2K Samsung AMOLED panel tuned by Pixelworks, it's brighter than any competing screen and, in general, more color-accurate. It's positively gorgeous. And unlike with the Galaxy S20 series, you can run it at its full glory in 2K-120Hz mode, where the S20 line makes you choose between resolution and frame rate. You can also kick it down to 60Hz or 1080p to save battery, but I didn't find much battery drain from using 120Hz because there's a setting to automatically downscale the screen when you aren't using high-frame-rate-friendly content. I have many more details about screen quality in a story I wrote in cooperation with DisplayMate Labs."
OnePlus 8 Pro,Design and Display,"The 8 Pro has a few more screen features I didn't find on the OnePlus 8. Comfort Tone is like Apple's TrueTone, changing the screen's white point under ambient light. Vibrant Color Effect Pro tries to upscale video content to HDR, enhancing contrast and color."
OnePlus 8 Pro,Design and Display,"There is very little 120Hz content available for phones, so the 8 Pro brings in a controversial feature from TVs: motion smoothing. Turn it on in Netflix or YouTube, and it upscales content to 120fps. Using my favorite video test track, the music video for Chvrches ""Empty Threat"" (a heartwarming tale of goths at a water park), smoothing changes the entire feel of the scene. Without smoothing, it's all a bit jerky in that familiar cinematic way—a little dreamlike, like a memory. With smoothing, things snap into reality like they were recorded on someone's smartphone. People have very different, and very strong emotional reactions to motion smoothing, but at least you can say it's a real option here if you want it."
OnePlus 8 Pro,Flagship Performance,"The OnePlus 8 Pro uses the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 chipset as the OnePlus 8, the Galaxy S20 line, and the LG V60. On the Geekbench processor benchmark and GFXBench's offscreen graphics benchmark, it performed just like those other phones, as you'd expect. That means about a 20- to 25-percent bump in performance over last year's flagships."
OnePlus 8 Pro,Flagship Performance,"We also like to use the PCMark benchmark, which tests general application performance, but its results were odd and inconsistent on the OnePlus 8 Pro; the phone scored higher in 2K screen mode than it did in HD screen mode, which shouldn't happen (lowering screen resolution improves benchmark performance), and in both modes it scored more similarly to last year's OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren than to the Galaxy S20. I'll chalk that up to something wrong in the benchmark app, as other benchmarks disagreed."
OnePlus 8 Pro,Flagship Performance,"The default model of the OnePlus 8 Pro has 8GB of fast LPDDR5 RAM and 128GB of storage; you can boost it to 12GB and 256GB for an extra $100. Storage speed, in general, is a big winner for this phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro rated 24154 on PCMag's specialized storage benchmark, as opposed to 18000 to 19000 on the Galaxy S20 series. That makes loading apps and saving photos feel snappy."
OnePlus 8 Pro,Flagship Performance,"OnePlus' version of Android 10, which it calls Oxygen OS, continues to be the fastest, smoothest Android skin other than Google's own. OnePlus keeps the bloatware to an absolute minimum, while offering lots of ways to tweak your system."
OnePlus 8 Pro,Flagship Performance,"You can change fonts or icon packs, adjust the screen color temperature or vividness, mess with the control buttons and alert slider, install multiple copies of social networking apps, or put some apps into an encrypted folder, for instance.

I found the in-display fingerprint sensor, just like other in-display sensors, not as good as a physical sensor, but not worse than, say, the S20's in-display sensor."
OnePlus 8 Pro,Flagship Performance,"Battery life on the 4,510mAh cell is good, considering the power of the screen. On the 120Hz 2K screen setting, playing YouTube over Wi-Fi, I got 10 hours, 15 minutes. Kicking it down to 60Hz only got me an extra 30 minutes. That's a little shorter than the standard OnePlus 8, but the OnePlus 8 has a 1080p screen, which naturally uses less power. The OnePlus 8 Pro works with the company's proprietary Warp Charge 30T charger, which took it to 48 percent in 20 minutes and to 100 percent in 50 minutes. That's a faster charge than Samsung offers."
OnePlus 8 Pro,Flagship Performance,"There's also a new charging option: wireless. The Pro works with standard Qi wireless charging pads such as my Logitech wireless charging cradle, but OnePlus also has a new, proprietary wireless charger that charges as fast as its wired charger does: about 21 percent every 10 minutes, and a whole charge in an hour. It doesn't even get hot, just a little warm. That's a radical new step, and the first time I've considered wireless charging to be really worth it."
OnePlus 8 Pro,Great on One Network,"On T-Mobile, and only T-Mobile, the OnePlus 8 Pro has excellent network performance. OnePlus tells me that the unlocked 8 Pro will work on the New T-Mobile's 5G networks, but not on AT&T or (probably) Verizon. It'll be 4G on those carriers."
OnePlus 8 Pro,Great on One Network,"There are four international models of the OnePlus 8 Pro, with four different sets of 5G frequency bands: US, EU, India, and China. The European model will work in India, but otherwise they aren't transferable across 5G networks. They all work on global 4G networks."

But unlike the Galaxy S20+, the Pro lacks millimeter-wave 5G. While T-Mobile doesn't have much millimeter-wave coverage right now—it's only in small parts of seven cities—the carrier has spent $2 billion acquiring millimeter-wave airwaves over the past few years."
OnePlus 8 Pro,Great on One Network,"The phone has all of the 4G bands used in the US, including the more obscure bands 46 (LAA) and 48 (CBRS), which are used to improve speeds in crowded urban areas."

OnePlus 8 Pro,Great on One Network,"The unlocked OnePlus 8 Pro has physical dual SIM slots. The second slot isn't active on my review unit, but the phone says it will be activated through a firmware upgrade. For now, the second SIM will be 4G even if the first one is 5G, although that might also change with future software upgrades."
OnePlus 8 Pro,A Good-Looking Camera,"The OnePlus 8 Pro has a 48-megapixel main camera, a 48-megapixel wide-angle camera, and an 8-megapixel telephoto camera, all based on a new Sony IMX689 sensor that has 1.12-micrometer pixels, larger than the 0.8-micrometer pixels you get with the OnePlus 7 Pro or OnePlus 8."
OnePlus 8 Pro,A Good-Looking Camera,"You can definitely see the difference. Photos taken with the OnePlus 8 Pro are sharper, with better dynamic range and background detail than on the OnePlus 8. Sometimes they're even better than the Galaxy S20+, at 1x at least. Samsung notoriously tends to oversharpen photos, and in some of my shots you can seen where the OnePlus 8 Pro's pictures look more natural."
OnePlus 8 Pro,A Good-Looking Camera,"Go to 3x, and the Galaxy S20+ pulls ahead, largely by virtue of its taking 12-megapixel images rather than 8-megapixel images. The OnePlus 8 Pro also clearly isn't optimized for greater than 3x zoom, and anything above that level looks highly digitally processed and washed out, worse than on the Galaxy S20 series (which still looks digitally processed)."
OnePlus 8 Pro,A Good-Looking Camera,"The OnePlus 8 Pro's 48-megapixel mode compares favorably with the Galaxy S20's 64-megapixel mode. Shrunk down to compete with the phone's own 12-megapixel images, daylight photos aren't blown out at all and are sharper. Indoor photos are a bit dimmer, but I only really noticed in very low light."
OnePlus 8 Pro,A Good-Looking Camera,"Low light is where the OnePlus 8 Pro's camera advantages really show up over the OnePlus 8. In my indoor, low-light shots, the 8 Pro's photos are brighter and have more detail than those captured by the OnePlus 8. But the Galaxy S20's far more flexible night mode crushes either OnePlus' Nightscape mode performance. The S20's night mode results in brighter images, and you can still zoom with the S20 at night, something you can't do on either of the OnePlus phones."
OnePlus 8 Pro,A Good-Looking Camera,"Video recording is 4K, not 8K, up to 60fps 4K or 240fps 1080p slow-mo. That's significantly below what the Galaxy S20 offers, which is 8K video and 960fps slow-mo.

OnePlus 8 Pro,Conclusions,"I really like a lot of what OnePlus is doing with the OnePlus 8 Pro. Display performance matters a lot to smartphone buyers, and it doesn't get any better than this. The OnePlus 8 Pro is also a fast, smooth phone with terrific software and a smart selection of cameras. If you're in a place where you think you won't get 5G anytime soon, or you're on T-Mobile and don't feel you need the S20 line's somewhat more advanced camera features (such as 8K recording), this is a better value than the Samsung Galaxy S20+ or the LG V60."
OnePlus 8 Pro,Conclusions,"But this is a weird time. 5G is expanding, the economy is cratering, and it doesn't feel responsible to recommend expensive flagships that don't support 5G. So as much as I like the OnePlus 8 Pro, I feel more comfortable naming the more affordable OnePlus 8 our Editors' Choice. No, it doesn't have the Pro's 2K screen, true 3x zoom camera, or wireless charging. But it offers greater 5G connectivity starting at $699, which is a better value than you'll find anywhere else."
